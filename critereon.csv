418,THE GOLDEN AGE OF TELEVISION,"The hugely popular live American television plays of the 1950s have become the stuff of legend. Combining elements of theater, radio, and filmmaking, they were produced at a moment when TV technology was growing more mobile and art was being made accessible to a newly suburban postwar demographic. These astonishingly choreographed, brilliantly acted, and socially progressive “teleplays” constituted an artistic high for the medium, bringing Broadway-quality drama to all of America. The award-winning programs included in this box set—originally curated for PBS in the early 1980s as the seriesThe Golden Age of Television,featuring recollections from key cast and crew members—were conceived by such up-and-comers as Rod Serling and John Frankenheimer and star the likes of Paul Newman, Mickey Rooney, Rod Steiger, Julie Harris, and Piper Laurie.MartyRenowned dramatist Paddy Chayefsky’s poignant and touching character study of a lonely, middle-aged butcher (Rod Steiger) looking for love helped usher in the naturalistic style of television drama in the 1950s.Marty,directed by Delbert Mann, remains an enduring classic of the age of live television.PatternsNothing less than a milestone in television drama, writer Rod Serling’sPatternsexamines a power struggle between a corporate boss (Everett Sloane), a washed-up company man (Ed Begley), and the young executive groomed to take his place (Richard Kiley).

Among the legendary French filmmaker’s finest achievements, the film takes as its ostensible subject the daily life of Juliette Janson (Marina Vlady), a housewife from the Paris suburbs who prostitutes herself for extra money. Yet this is only a template for Godard to spin off into provocative philosophical tangents and gorgeous images.2 or 3 Things I Know About Heris perhaps Godard’s most revelatory look at consumer culture, shot in ravishing widescreen color by Raoul Coutard.",Jean-Luc Godard,France,1967,French,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/2d01c1355a26b42297d80a960899c4f5/93Btri2IgKEjkVfyjMctarS9VtARHo_large.jpg,0060304
1,3:10 TO YUMA,"In this beautifully shot, psychologically complex western, Van Heflin is a mild-mannered cattle rancher who takes on the task of shepherding a captured outlaw (played with cucumber-cool charisma by Glenn Ford) to the train that will deliver him to prison. This apparently simple mission turns into a nerve-racking cat-and-mouse game that tests each man’s particular brand of honor.

When Millie takes Pinky in as her roommate, Pinky’s hero worship evolves into something far stranger and more sinister than either could have anticipated.

3,"4 MONTHS, 3 WEEKS AND 2 DAYS","Romanian filmmaker Cristian Mungiu shot to international prominence with this rigorously realistic Palme d’Or–winning second feature. In 1987, during the dictatorship of Nicolae Ceaușescu, college roommates Otilia (Anamaria Marinca) and Găbița (Laura Vasiliu) seek an illegal abortion for Găbița. In unflinching but empathetic detail, the film recounts the events of twenty-four perilous hours in their lives, culminating in their encounter with a manipulative and menacing abortionist (Vlad Ivanov).

5,12 ANGRY MEN,"12 Angry Men,by Sidney Lumet, may be the most radical courtroom drama in cinema history. A behind-closed-doors look at the American legal system that is as riveting as it is spare, this iconic adaptation of Reginald Rose’s teleplay stars Henry Fonda as the dissenting member on a jury of white men ready to pass judgment on a Puerto Rican teenager charged with murdering his father. The result is a saga of epic proportions that plays out over a tense afternoon in one sweltering room.

Setting out to reconstruct the moments immediately before and after a photograph is taken, Kiarostami selected twenty-four still images—most of them stark landscapes inhabited only by foraging birds and other wildlife—and digitally animated each one into its own subtly evolving four-and-a-half-minute vignette, creating a series of poignant studies in movement, perception, and time.

17,THE AGE OF INNOCENCE,"No filmmaker captures the grandeur and energy of New York like Martin Scorsese.

Director Andrew Haigh carries the tradition of British realist cinema to artful new heights in45 Years,weaving the momentous into the mundane as the pair go about their daily lives, while the evocatively flat, wintry Norfolk landscape frames their struggle to maintain an increasingly untenable status quo.

Kirk Douglas gives the fiercest performance of his career as Chuck Tatum, an amoral newspaper reporter who washes up in dead-end Albuquerque, happens upon the scoop of a lifetime, and will do anything to keep getting the lurid headlines. Wilder’s follow-up toSunset Boulevardis an even darker vision, a no-holds-barred exposé of the American media’s appetite for sensation that has gotten only more relevant with time.",Billy Wilder,United States,1951,English,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/2fe2ca53e58aeac665d09fae9748347f/3oBi9k9iUQzTspeg9nyJiO6UF2bPLA_large.jpg,0043338
14,AN ACTOR’S REVENGE,"A uniquely prolific and chameleonic figure of world cinema, Kon Ichikawa delivered a burst of stylistic bravado with this intricate tale of betrayal and retribution. Set in the cloistered world of nineteenth-century kabuki theater, the film charts a female impersonator’s attempts to avenge the deaths of his parents, who were driven to insanity and suicide by a trio of corrupt men. Ichikawa takes the conventions of melodrama and turns them on their head, bringing the hero’s fractured psyche to life in boldly experimental widescreen compositions infused with kaleidoscopic color, pop-art influences, and meticulous choreography. Anchored by a magnificently androgynous performance by Kazuo Hasegawa, reprising a role he had played on-screen three decades earlier,An Actor’s Revengeis an eye-popping examination of how the illusions of art intersect with life.",Kon Ichikawa,Japan,1963,Japanese,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/4b189bbc4839b45ecfee6d8546d303e6/KaW2t9UP1dYbpFxJDSlXEbSApZ8SaV_large.jpg,0057710

19,AKIRA KUROSAWA’S DREAMS,"Unfolding in a series of eight mythic vignettes, this late work by Akira Kurosawa was inspired by the beloved director’s own nighttime visions, along with stories from Japanese folklore. In a visually sumptuous journey through the master’s imagination, tales of childlike wonder give way to apocalyptic apparitions: a young boy stumbles on a fox wedding in a forest; a soldier confronts the ghosts of the war dead; a power plant meltdown smothers a seaside landscape in radioactive fumes. Interspersed with reflections on the redemptive power of creation, including a richly textured tribute to Vincent van Gogh (who is played by Martin Scorsese),Akira Kurosawa’s Dreamsis both a showcase for its maker’s artistry at its most unbridled and a deeply personal lament for a world at the mercy of human ignorance.",Akira Kurosawa,Japan,1990,Japanese,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/e9fc8a91b2f9ebe10efb6edde367dffe/LRIg86I1YijdtiaQ7G1aWN6USnhprt_large.jpg,0100998

This story of Teutonic knights vanquished by Prince Alexander Nevsky’s tactical brilliance resonated deeply with a Soviet Union concerned with the rise of Nazi Germany. Widely imitated—most notably by Laurence Olivier''s Battle of Agincourt re-creation forHenry V—the Battle on the Ice scene remains one of the most famous audio-visual experiments in film history, perfectly blending action with the rousing score of Sergei Prokofiev.",Sergei Eisenstein,Soviet Union,1938,Russian,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/19c902a73e243b9293de4c717430f639/H1rWEdJtowN7Xh9vSnOvPU9I6y0AgT_large.jpg,0029850
22,ALICE IN THE CITIES,"The first of the road films that would come to define the career of Wim Wenders, the magnificentAlice in the Citiesis an emotionally generous and luminously shot odyssey. A German journalist (Rüdiger Vogler) is driving across the United States to research an article; it’s a disappointing trip, in which he is unable to truly connect with what he sees. Things change, however, when he has no choice but to take a young girl named Alice (Yella Rottländer) with him on his return trip to Germany, after her mother (Lisa Kreuzer)—whom he has just met—leaves the child in his care.

One night, Margo Channing (Bette Davis) entertains a surprise dressing-room visitor: her most adoring fan, the shy, wide-eyed Eve Harrington (Anne Baxter). But as Eve becomes a fixture in Margo’s life, the Broadway legend soon realizes that her supposed admirer intends to use her and everyone in her circle, including George Sanders’s acid-tongued critic, as stepping-stones to stardom.

28,ALL THAT HEAVEN ALLOWS,"This heartbreakingly beautiful indictment of 1950s American mores by Douglas Sirk follows the blossoming love between a well-off widow (Jane Wyman) and her handsome and earthy younger gardener (Rock Hudson). When their romance prompts the scorn of her children and country club friends, she must decide whether to pursue her own happiness or carry on a lonely, hemmed-in existence for the sake of the approval of others.

29,ALL THAT JAZZ,"The preternaturally gifted director and choreographer Bob Fosse turned the camera on his own life for this madly imaginative, self-excoriating musical masterpiece. Roy Scheider gives the performance of his career as Joe Gideon, whose exhausting work schedule—mounting a Broadway production by day and editing his latest movie by night—and routine of amphetamines, booze, and sex are putting his health at serious risk. Fosse burrows into Gideon’s (and his own) mind, rendering his interior world as phantasmagoric spectacle. Assembled with visionary editing that makes dance come alive on-screen as never before, and overflowing with sublime footwork by the likes of Ann Reinking, Leland Palmer, and Ben Vereen,All That Jazzpushes the musical genre to personal depths and virtuosic aesthetic heights.",Bob Fosse,United States,1979,English,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/8ee8b30fd8b04c0925a571a6aa83551b/AMKYaHIhWGuRsN3wZvDOZojSyG2ZaD_large.jpg,0078754
30,ALL THESE WOMEN,"Conceived as an amusing diversion in the wake of Ingmar Bergman’s despairing trilogy, this comedy is the director’s first film in color, and it is an opulent visual feast. Working from a bawdy screenplay he cowrote with actor Erland Josephson, about a supercilious critic drawn into the dizzying orbit of a famous cellist, Bergman brings together buoyant comic turns by a number of his frequent collaborators, including Jarl Kulle, Eva Dahlbeck, Harriet Andersson, and Bibi Andersson.All These Women,in which Bergman pokes fun at the pretensions of drawing-room art, possesses a distinctly playful atmosphere and carefree cadences.",Ingmar Bergman,Sweden,1964,Swedish,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/a542db89247489d8305dafba6620ad4e/gNegY1fNjIg43C6vk8OCMNf2g1aS35_large.jpg,0058124
32,AMARCORD,"This carnivalesque portrait of provincial Italy during the fascist period, the most personal film by Federico Fellini, satirizes the director’s youth and turns daily life into a circus of social rituals, adolescent desires, male fantasies, and political subterfuge, all set to Nino Rota’s classic, nostalgia-tinged score.

Filmed on location in Hamburg and Paris, with some scenes shot in grimy, late-seventies New York City, Wenders’s international breakout is a stripped-down crime story that mixes West German and American film flavors, and it features cameos by filmmakers Jean Eustache, Samuel Fuller, and Nicholas Ray.",Wim Wenders,Germany,1977,"English,                                          French,                                          German",https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/bfc170fd79de2f1298ae0115534a9594/YIHd0ub4uOeANf4KvdgkkwZFqg0p6D_large.jpg,0075675

35,LE AMICHE,"This major early achievement by Michelangelo Antonioni bears the first signs of the cinema-changing style for which he would soon be world-famous.Le amiche(The Girlfriends) is a brilliantly observed, fragmentary depiction of modern bourgeois life, conveyed from the perspective of five Turinese women. As four of the friends try to make sense of the suicide attempt of the fifth, they find themselves examining their own troubled romantic lives. With suggestions of the theme of modern alienation and the fastidious visual abstraction that would define his later masterpieces such asL’avventura, L’eclisse,andRed Desert,Antonioni’s film is a devastating take on doomed love and fraught friendship.Le amichewas restored by the Cineteca di Bologna at L’Immagine Ritrovata.

This gripping envelope-pusher, the most popular film by Hollywood provocateur Otto Preminger, was groundbreaking for the frankness of its discussion of sex—but more than anything else, it is a striking depiction of the power of words. Featuring an outstanding supporting cast—with a young George C. Scott as a fiery prosecutor and the legendary attorney Joseph N.

But this most confrontational work yet from one of contemporary cinema’s most controversial artists is no mere provocation.

Less a documentary than a visual poem, Teshigahara’s film takes viewers on a tour of Gaudí’s truly spectacular architecture, including his massive, still-unfinished masterpiece, the Sagrada Família basilica in Barcelona.

Yet a minor-key romance with a hilariously dispassionate meter maid (Susanna Haavisto) might provide a light at the end of a very dark tunnel.Ariel, which boasts a terrific soundtrack of Finnish tango and Baltic pop music and lovely cinematography by Kaurismäki’s longtime cameraman Timo Salmimen, put its director on the international map.",Aki Kaurismäki,Finland,1988,Finnish,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/b161a43e4f76d2c7641d3902c02b2580/7363A7rOIsQ8A29xubLhSwb9iig7jw_large.jpg,0094675
56,ARMY OF SHADOWS,"This masterpiece by Jean-Pierre Melville about the French Resistance went unreleased in the United States for thirty-seven years, until its triumphant theatrical debut in 2006.

In this incendiary environment we find Home Army soldier Maciek Chelmicki, who has been ordered to assassinate an incoming commissar. But a mistake stalls his progress and leads him to Krystyna, a beautiful barmaid who gives him a glimpse of what his life could be.

59,AS LONG AS YOU’VE GOT YOUR HEALTH,"In this endlessly diverting compendium of four short films, Pierre Etaix regards the 1960s from his askew but astute perspective. Each part is as technically impressive as it is riotous: a man attempts to read a novel about vampires beside his sleeping wife but cannot seem to separate reality from fiction; a simple afternoon at the movies becomes a consumer-culture assault; a jarringly noisy urban landscape keeps a city’s population on edge; and a day in the country means something different to a picnicking city couple, a hunter, and a farmer.",Pierre Etaix,France,1966,French,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/4404f9cbcfb2a596af244bfe4b4715be/qfHhR4ufEx2Joe1dxVp63YxDrVDe4i_large.jpg,0207145
60,THE ASPHALT JUNGLE,"In a smog-choked city somewhere in the American Midwest, an aging criminal mastermind, newly released from prison, hatches a plan for a million-dollar jewel heist and draws a wealthy lawyer and a cherry-picked trio of outlaws into his carefully devised but inevitably doomed scheme. Anchored by an abundance of nuanced performances from a gifted ensemble—including a tight-jawed Sterling Hayden and a sultry Marilyn Monroe in her breakout role—this gritty crime classic by John Huston climaxes in a meticulously detailed anatomy of a robbery that has reverberated through the genre ever since. An uncommonly naturalistic view of a seamy underworld,The Asphalt Junglepainstakingly depicts the calm professionalism and toughness of its gangster heroes while evincing a remarkable depth of compassion for their all-too-human fragility, and it showcases a master filmmaker at the height of his powers.",John Huston,United States,1950,English,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/5915895741543b0081c1afe507308335/WLD2n1FIo9i7BTFQRoTryfcBlF1rse_large.jpg,0042208

62,AU HASARD BALTHAZAR,"A profound masterpiece from one of the most revered filmmakers in the history of cinema, Robert Bresson’sAu hasard Balthazarfollows the donkey Balthazar as he is passed from owner to owner, some kind and some cruel but all with motivations beyond his understanding. Balthazar, whose life parallels that of his first keeper, Marie, is truly a beast of burden, suffering the sins of humankind. But despite his powerlessness, he accepts his fate nobly. Through Bresson’s unconventional approach to composition, sound, and narrative, this simple story becomes a moving parable about purity and transcendence.",Robert Bresson,France,1966,French,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/3bfeccc88c1706a5dd401df39582d7cf/eM5j469VIjNvWJjFs4OGOnOpTBbpXJ_large.jpg,0060138
63,AU REVOIR LES ENFANTS,"Au revoir les enfantstells a heartbreaking story of friendship and devastating loss concerning two boys living in Nazi-occupied France. At a provincial Catholic boarding school, the precocious youths enjoy true camaraderie—until a secret is revealed.

64,AN AUTUMN AFTERNOON,"The last film by Yasujiro Ozu was also his final masterpiece, a gently heartbreaking story about a man’s dignifed resignation to life’s shifting currents and society’s modernization. Though the widower Shuhei (frequent Ozu leading man Chishu Ryu) has been living comfortably for years with his grown daughter, a series of events leads him to accept and encourage her marriage and departure from their home.

65,AUTUMN SONATA,"Autumn Sonatawas the only collaboration between cinema’s two great Bergmans: Ingmar and Ingrid, the monumental star ofCasablanca.The grande dame, playing an icy concert pianist, is matched beat for beat in ferocity by the filmmaker’s recurring lead Liv Ullmann, as her eldest daughter.

66,L’AVVENTURA,"Michelangelo Antonioni invented a new film grammar with this masterwork. An iconic piece of challenging 1960s cinema and a gripping narrative on its own terms,L’avventuraconcerns the enigmatic disappearance of a young woman during a yachting trip off the coast of Sicily, and the search taken up by her disaffected lover (Gabriele Ferzetti) and best friend (Monica Vitti, in her breakout role).

But try as they might to move on, the mischievous Jerry can’t help meddling in Lucy’s ill-matched engagement to a corn-fed Oklahoma businessman (Ralph Bellamy), and a mortified Lucy begins to realize that she may be saying goodbye to the only dance partner capable of following her lead. Directed by the versatile Leo McCarey, a master of improvisation and slapstick as well as a keen and sympathetic observer of human folly,The Awful Truthis a warm but unsparing comedy about two people whose flaws only make them more irresistible.",Leo McCarey,United States,1937,English,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/c6405a3dc564179df63c65d55066a4ae/9eQtQWCuRD4Bz04ICaKTd207nco97Z_large.jpg,0028597
68,BAAL,"Volker Schlöndorff transported Bertolt Brecht’s 1918 debut play to contemporary West Germany for this vicious experiment in adaptation, seldom seen for nearly half a century. Oozing with brutish charisma, Rainer Werner Fassbinder embodies the eponymous anarchist poet, who feels that bourgeois society has rejected him and sets off on a schnapps-soaked rampage. Hewing faithfully to Brecht’s text, Schlöndorff juxtaposes the theatricality of the prose with bare-bones, handheld 16 mm camera work, which gives immediacy to this savage story of rebellion. Featuring a supporting cast drawn from Fassbinder’s troupe of theater actors that also includes Margarethe von Trotta,Baaldemonstrates the uncompromising vision of its director, a trailblazer of the New German Cinema.",Volker Schlöndorff,West Germany,1970,German,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/eae2794b63eb565a9518d0ddc6dc4800/MfEB5BHM5873COrnchiYFPxygZYNP8_large.jpg,3591138
69,BABETTE’S FEAST,"At once a rousing paean to artistic creation, a delicate evocation of divine grace, and the ultimate film about food, the Oscar-winningBabette’s Feastis a deeply beloved treasure of cinema. Directed by Gabriel Axel and adapted from a story by Isak Dinesen, it is the lovingly layered tale of a French housekeeper with a mysterious past who brings quiet revolution in the form of one exquisite meal to a circle of starkly pious villagers in late nineteenth-century Denmark.Babette’s Feastcombines earthiness and reverence in an indescribably moving depiction of sensual pleasure that goes to your head like fine champagne.",Gabriel Axel,Denmark,1987,"Danish,                                          French,                                          Swedish",https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/aca8036540d101ce120920bb83b906a1/RoF9kSXwRWFuCBu2KdSfS1v6oIsLis_large.jpg,0092603
70,BABO 73,"Taylor Mead plays the president of the United Status, who, when he isn’t at the White House—a dilapidated Victorian—conducts his top-secret affairs on a deserted beach.

71,BADLANDS,"Badlandsannounced the arrival of a major talent: Terrence Malick. His impressionistic take on the notorious Charles Starkweather killing spree of the late 1950s uses a serial-killer narrative as a springboard for an oblique teenage romance, lovingly and idiosyncratically enacted by Martin Sheen and Sissy Spacek. The film introduced many of the elements that would earn Malick his passionate following: the enigmatic approach to narrative and character, the unusual use of voice-over, the juxtaposition of human violence with natural beauty, the poetic investigation of American dreams and nightmares. This debut has spawned countless imitations, but none have equaled its strange sublimity.",Terrence Malick,United States,1973,English,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/a54f64b1b0ef213b885f58bb6bd0a52c/mIKKJYC8m5eLi8ybTuoSZOyyCtoukK_large.jpg,0069762
72,BAD TIMING,"Amid the decaying elegance of cold-war Vienna, psychoanalyst Dr. Alex Linden (Art Garfunkel) becomes mired in an erotically charged affair with the elusive Milena Flaherty (Theresa Russell). When their all-consuming passion takes a life-threatening turn, Inspector Netusil (Harvey Keitel) is assigned to piece together the sordid details.

73,THE BAKER’S WIFE,"The warmth and wit of celebrated playwright turned cinema auteur Marcel Pagnol shine in this enchanting slice-of-life comedy. Returning to the Provençal countryside he knew intimately, Pagnol draws a vivid portrait of a close-knit village where the marital woes of a sweetly deluded baker (the inimitable Raimu, praised by no less than Orson Welles as “the greatest actor who ever lived”) snowball into a scandal that engulfs the town. Marrying the director’s abiding concern for the experiences of ordinary people with an understated but superbly judged visual style,The Baker’s Wifeis at once wonderfully droll and piercingly perceptive in its depiction of the complexities of human relationships.",Marcel Pagnol,France,1938,French,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/0038054059869d507d9fa68b3ae7a378/dm0IkYZsXXqgFyLW4WLEmrePDHITZS_large.jpg,0030127
74,THE BAKERY GIRL OF MONCEAU,"Simple, delicate, and jazzy, the first of the Moral Tales shows the stirrings of what would become the Eric Rohmer style: unfussy naturalistic shooting, ironic first-person voice-over, and the image of the “unknowable” woman. A law student (played by producer and future director Barbet Schroeder) with a roving eye and a large appetite stuffs himself full of sugar cookies and pastries daily in order to garner the attentions of the pretty brunette who works in a quaint Paris bakery. But is he truly interested, or is she just a sweet diversion?",Eric Rohmer,France,1963,French,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/473d56f95abb50e7aacadbd88f68c417/hrNgbk1PHREr4sxHJGRqzJbNQlBz7K_large.jpg,0056884

As he journeys home, Alyosha encounters the devastation of his war-torn country, witnesses glimmers of hope among the people, and falls in love.

76,THE BALLAD OF GREGORIO CORTEZ,"Forced to run from the Texas Rangers after a heated misunderstanding leads to the death of a lawman, Mexican American farmer Gregorio Cortez sets off in desperate flight, evading a massive manhunt on horseback for days. Producer-star Edward James Olmos, seeking to shed new light on a historical incident that had been enshrined in a corrido (folk song), enlisted director Robert M. Young, a longtime practitioner of socially engaged realism, to helm this trailblazing independent film, a landmark of Chicano cinema. Shifting its perspective between the pursuers and the pursued,The Ballad of Gregorio Cortezis a thrilling chase film and a nuanced procedural that peels away the layers of prejudice and myth surrounding Cortez, uncovering the true story of an ordinary man persecuted by the law and transfigured by legend.",Robert M.

77,THE BALLAD OF NARAYAMA,"This haunting, kabuki-inflected version of a Japanese folk legend is set in a remote mountain village where food is scarce and tradition dictates that citizens who have reached their seventieth year must be carried to the summit of Mount Narayama and left there to die. The sacrificial elder at the center of the tale is Orin (Kinuyo Tanaka), a dignified and dutiful woman who spends her dwindling days securing the happiness of her loyal widowed son with a respectable new wife.

78,BAMBOOZLED,"With this blisteringly funny, unapologetically confrontational satire, writer-director Spike Lee examined the past, present, and future of racism in American popular culture, issuing a daring provocation to creators and consumers alike. Under pressure to help revive his network’s low ratings, television writer Pierre Delacroix (Damon Wayans) hits on an explosively offensive idea: bringing back blackface for a “new-millennium minstrel show.” The white network executives love it, and so do audiences, forcing Pierre and his collaborators to confront their public’s insatiable appetite for dehumanizing stereotypes. Shot primarily on unvarnished digital video and boasting spot-on performances from Savion Glover, Tommy Davidson, Jada Pinkett Smith, Michael Rapaport, Mos Def, and Paul Mooney,Bamboozledis a stinging indictment of mass entertainment at the turn of the twenty-first century that looks more damning with each passing year.",Spike Lee,United States,2000,English,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/621ace9afe23a305cd3900a50b0ee678/s48ebrkllPeu1rDdXBVnzKQ9ZRR7u4_large.jpg,0215545
79,BAND OF OUTSIDERS,"Four years afterBreathless,Jean-Luc Godard reimagined the gangster film even more radically withBand of Outsiders(Bande à part). In it, two restless young men (Sami Frey and Claude Brasseur) enlist the object of both of their fancies (Anna Karina) to help them commit a robbery—in her own home. This audacious and wildly entertaining French New Wave gem is at once sentimental and insouciant, effervescently romantic and melancholy, and it features some of Godard’s most memorable set pieces, including the headlong race through the Louvre and the unshakably cool Madison dance sequence.",Jean-Luc Godard,France,1964,French,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/ae260bc49b38999ae5d987f2bac9aeab/Leo6yt5ZClpT2WA4trT7idTMnGhNug_large.jpg,0057869

A pair of preppy yet constitutionally mismatched American cousins—a salesman and a navy officer—argue about romance and politics while working in the beautiful Spanish city of the film’s title. Set during the eighties,Barcelonaexplores topics both heady (American exceptionalism, Cold War foreign policy) and hilarious (the ins and outs of international dating, the proper shaving method) while remaining a constantly witty delight, featuring a sharp young cast that includes Taylor Nichols, Chris Eigeman, and Mira Sorvino.",Whit Stillman,United States,1994,English,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/5edbdd9a71ff33ff8fe1c30044aff9ff/tqYv26202uYJDHcI0i3JxQRbXfJUvq_large.jpg,0497465
82,THE BARON OF ARIZONA,"In one of his own favorite roles, Vincent Price portrays legendary swindler James Addison Reavis, who in 1880 concocted an elaborate and dangerous hoax to name himself the Baron of Arizona, and therefore inherit all the land in the state.

83,BARRY LYNDON,"Stanley Kubrick bent the conventions of the historical drama to his own will in this dazzling vision of a pitiless aristocracy, adapted from a novel by William Makepeace Thackeray. In picaresque detail,Barry Lyndonchronicles the adventures of an incorrigible trickster (Ryan O’Neal) whose opportunism takes him from an Irish farm to the battlefields of the Seven Years’ War and the parlors of high society. For the most sumptuously crafted film of his career, Kubrick recreated the decadent surfaces and intricate social codes of the period, evoking the light and texture of eighteenth-century painting with the help of pioneering cinematographic techniques and lavish costume and production design, all of which earned Academy Awards. The result is a masterpiece—a sardonic, devastating portrait of a vanishing world whose opulence conceals the moral vacancy at its heart.",Stanley Kubrick,"United States,                                              United Kingdom",1975,English,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/01163ccf334f69f25ce81cb465a9c6d2/kEcq9HEnTRAPAenkxdbo5kYyqIsiTT_large.jpg,0072684

As violence escalates on both sides, children shoot soldiers at point-blank range, women plant bombs in cafés, and French soldiers resort to torture to break the will of the insurgents.

His absorbing landmark debut,Le beau Serge,follows a successful yet sickly young man (Jean‑Claude Brialy) who returns home to the small village where he grew up. There, he finds himself at odds with his former close friend (Gérard Blain)—now unhappily married and a wretched alcoholic—and the provincial life he represents.

89,BEAUTY AND THE BEAST,"Jean Cocteau’s sublime adaptation of Mme. Leprince de Beaumont’s fairy-tale masterpiece—in which the pure love of a beautiful girl melts the heart of a feral but gentle beast—is a landmark of motion picture fantasy, with unforgettably romantic performances by Jean Marais and Josette Day.

The couple soon find their vacation upended, however, by long-simmering problems that come to a boil.

After they hit it off on a train bound for Vienna, the Paris university student Celine and the scrappy American tourist Jesse impulsively decide to spend a day together before he returns to the U.S. the next morning.

95,BEING JOHN MALKOVICH,"Have you ever wanted to be someone else? Or, more specifically, have you ever wanted to crawl through a portal hidden in an anonymous office building and thereby enter the cerebral cortex of John Malkovich for fifteen minutes, before being spat out on the side of the New Jersey Turnpike? Then director Spike Jonze and writer Charlie Kaufman have the movie for you. Melancholy marionettes, office drudgery, a frizzy-haired Cameron Diaz—but that’s not all! Surrealism, possession, John Cusack, a domesticated primate, Freud, Catherine Keener, non sequiturs, and absolutely no romance!

96,BEING THERE,"In one of his most finely tuned performances, Peter Sellers plays the pure-hearted, childlike Chance, a gardener who is forced into the wilds of Washington, D.C., when his wealthy guardian dies. Shocked to discover that the real world doesn’t respond to the click of a remote, Chance stumbles into celebrity after being taken under the wing of a tycoon (Melvyn Douglas, in an Oscar-winning performance), who mistakes his protégé’s horticultural mumblings for sagacious pronouncements on life and politics, and whose wife (Shirley MacLaine) targets Chance as the object of her desire. Adapted from a novel by Jerzy Kosinski, this satire, both deeply melancholy and hilarious, is the culmination of Hal Ashby’s remarkable string of films in the 1970s, and a carefully modulated examination of the ideals, anxieties, and media-fueled delusions that shaped American culture during that decade.",Hal Ashby,United States,1979,English,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/2a5c9ac31b12fc4efa1972c2d8906d4e/uRxZHyQUbdioYV50CFQ0GMbUSe7LIh_large.jpg,0078841
97,BELLE DE JOUR,"Catherine Deneuve’s porcelain perfection hides a cracked interior in one of the actress’s most iconic roles: Séverine, a Paris housewife who begins secretly spending her after­noon hours working in a bordello. This surreal and erotic late-sixties daydream from provocateur for the ages Luis Buñuel is an examination of desire and fetishistic pleasure (its characters’ and its viewers’), as well as a gently absurdist take on contemporary social mores and class divisions. Fantasy and reality commingle in this burst of cinematic transgression, which was one of Buñuel’s biggest hits.",Luis Buñuel,France,1967,French,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/ea08b0b7f8f9cd31e39a14bfa36e95a8/2emaq5HhNTvZEejNqAL74jOsL3W9B2_large.jpg,0061395
98,BERGMAN ISLAND,"Just four years before his death, legendary filmmaker Ingmar Bergman sat down with Swedish documentarian Marie Nyreröd at his home on Fårö Island to discuss his work, his fears, his regrets, and his ongoing artistic passion. This resulted in the most breathtakingly candid series of interviews that the famously reclusive director ever took part in, later edited into the feature-length filmBergman Island.In-depth, revealing, and packed with choice anecdotes about Bergman’s oeuvre, as well as his personal life, Nyreröd’s film is an unforgettable final glimpse of a man who transformed cinema.",Marie Nyreröd,Sweden,2006,Swedish,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/4caa477448c9fe2ee28f80df08f4d89b/NmCRkRglJzsgL3AKwNshj7ENlgQZIN_large.jpg,6910282
153,BREATHLESS,"There was beforeBreathless,and there was afterBreathless.Jean-Luc Godard burst onto the film scene in 1960 with this jazzy, free-form, and sexy homage to the American film genres that inspired him as a writer forCahiers du cinéma.With its lack of polish, surplus of attitude, anything-goes crime narrative, and effervescent young stars Jean-Paul Belmondo and Jean Seberg,Breathlesshelped launch the French New Wave and ensured that cinema would never be the same.",Jean-Luc Godard,France,1960,French,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/3cef6f35153633b115fa86b7b7859b48/KLThdkATmWy4MXuzvzroYoVykInbAI_large.jpg,0053472
99,BERLIN ALEXANDERPLATZ,"Rainer Werner Fassbinder’s controversial, fifteen-hourBerlin Alexanderplatz,based on Alfred Döblin’s great modernist novel, was the crowning achievement of a prolific director who, at age thirty-four, had already made over thirty films. Fassbinder’s immersive epic follows the hulking, childlike ex-convict Franz Biberkopf (Günter Lamprecht) as he attempts to “become an honest soul” amid the corrosive urban landscape of Weimar-era Germany. With equal parts cynicism and humanity, Fassbinder details a mammoth portrait of a common man struggling to survive in a viciously uncommon time.Berlin Alexanderplatzwas shot at a speed of 25 frames per second. Due to technical discrepancies between PAL and NTSC standards, the film is presented on the DVD edition at a slightly slower speed. On the Blu-ray edition, however, it was possible to present the film at its original speed.

100,LA BÊTE HUMAINE,"Based on the classic Émile Zola novel, Jean Renoir''sLa bête humainewas one of the legendary director''s greatest popular successes—and earned star Jean Gabin a permanent place in the hearts of his countrymen. Part poetic realism, part film noir, the film is a hard-boiled and suspenseful journey into the tormented psyche of a workingman.",Jean Renoir,France,1938,French,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/456aa86ccbb3e2bfd9f72ddcbaeeacec/kSgP1xkaTvYm2ZbzJp7Sv7F2UIEpCZ_large.jpg,0029957
118,BLACK PANTHERS,"Agnès Varda turns her camera on an Oakland demonstration against the imprisonment of activist and Black Panthers cofounder Huey P. Newton.

101,BETTY BLUE,"When the easygoing would-be novelist Zorg (Jean-Hugues Anglade) meets the tempestuous Betty (Béatrice Dalle, in a magnetic breakout performance) in a sunbaked French beach town, it’s the beginning of a whirlwind love affair that sees the pair turn their backs on conventional society in favor of the hedonistic pursuit of freedom, adventure, and carnal pleasure. But as the increasingly erratic Betty’s grip on reality begins to falter, Zorg finds himself willing to do things he never expected to protect both her fragile sanity and their tenuous existence together. Adapted from the hit novel37°2 le matinby Philippe Djian, Jean-Jacques Beineix’s art-house smash—presented here in its extended director’s cut—is a sexy, crazy, careening joyride of a romance that burns with the passion and beyond-reason fervor of all-consuming love.",Jean-Jacques Beineix,France,1986,French,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/374aba96c6d088f549db6bfdfcfdc952/NXvOjh0NFLCxBARIs0E88NEgGKbUg0_large.jpg,0090563
102,BEWARE OF A HOLY WHORE,"In Rainer Werner Fassbinder’s brazen depiction of the alternating currents of lethargy and mayhem inherent in moviemaking, a film crew—played by, and not so loosely based on, his own frequent collaborators—deals with an aloof star (Eddie Constantine), an abusive director (Lou Castel), and a financially troubled production. Inspired by the hellish process of makingWhityearlier the same year, this is a vicious look at behind-the-scenes dysfunction.",Rainer Werner Fassbinder,Germany,1970,German,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/16c6f613b1846df633cb7c46d2863e2e/5Ynu5q1SbC87sYRlXAwnxXnIQsXpzN_large.jpg,0067962
103,BEYOND THE HILLS,"With this arresting drama based on notorious real-life events, Cristian Mungiu mounts a complex inquiry into faith, fanaticism, and indifference. At a desolate Romanian monastery, a young novice nun, Voichița (Cosmina Stratan), reunites with her former companion Alina (Cristina Flutur), who plans to take her to Germany. But Voichița proves unwilling to abandon her calling, and Alina becomes increasingly desperate to reclaim her devotion, putting the outsider at odds with the monastery’s ascetic priest—and precipitating a painfully misguided, brutal attempt to save her soul. A naturalistic tragedy with the dark force of a folktale, anchored by the fraught dynamic between cinema newcomers Flutur and Stratan (who shared the best actress prize at Cannes),Beyond the Hillsbears powerful witness to individuals at cross-purposes and institutions ill-equipped to help those most in need.",Cristian Mungiu,Romania,2012,Romanian,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/7e53562a1bc3ae00237eef595c1403a8/wIChDWmCVilmqMKIwe5NNXjw3cVGSA_large.jpg,2258281
104,BEYOND THE LAW,"Mailer’s belief that we’re all capable of being either police or criminals was the impetus for his second feature, which takes place over the course of one feverish night in a Manhattan police precinct and neighboring bar. The texture of the black-and-white stock and the intense depiction of the police lineup process lend the film a rugged, journalistic feel. In addition to Mailer, who cast himself as tough-guy Irish cop Francis Xavier Pope,Beyond the Lawfeatures Rip Torn and George Plimpton.",Norman Mailer,United States,1968,English,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/b069abe928385f97336491824e25923b/MjNYU96ZyBqDUuGvnpoqXLFz6MVKPS_large.jpg,11161374
105,BEYOND THE VALLEY OF THE DOLLS,"In 1970, Twentieth Century-Fox, impressed by the visual zing “King of the Nudies” Russ Meyer had been bringing  to bargain-basement exploitation fare, handed the director a studio budget and the title to one of its biggest hits,Valley of the Dolls.With a satirical screenplay by Roger Ebert,Beyond the Valley of the Dollsfollows three young female rockers going Hollywood, in hell-bent sixties style, under the spell of a flamboyant producer—whose decadent bashes showcase Meyer’s trademark libidinal exuberance. Transgressive and outrageous, this big-studio version of a debaucherous midnight movie is an addictively entertaining romp from one of cinema’s great outsider artists.",Russ Meyer,United States,1970,English,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/2167cc9cbbff1fb5f6d9da77048b9d62/XwfKpPZ10ASQ47REenWvU0tXFFUwKN_large.jpg,0065466
106,BICYCLE THIEVES,"Hailed around the world as one of the greatest movies ever made, the Academy Award–winningBicycle Thieves,directed by Vittorio De Sica, defined an era in cinema. In poverty-stricken postwar Rome, a man is on his first day of a new job that offers hope of salvation for his desperate family when his bicycle, which he needs for work, is stolen. With his young son in tow, he sets off to track down the thief. Simple in construction and profoundly rich in human insight,Bicycle Thievesembodies the greatest strengths of the Italian neorealist movement: emotional clarity, social rectitude, and brutal honesty.",Vittorio De Sica,Italy,1948,Italian,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/a020c4272223b01fa84782ca7f80ef3b/EtDUUmNY6vAX9TcTq0uRKG4BVqToH3_large.jpg,0040522
107,THE BIG CHILL,"After the shocking suicide of their friend, a group of thirtysomethings reunite for his funeral and end up spending the weekend together, reminiscing about their shared past as children of the sixties and confronting the uncertainty of their lives as adults of the eighties. Poignant and warmly humorous in equal measure, this baby boomer milestone made a star of writer-director Lawrence Kasdan and is perhaps the decade’s defining ensemble film, featuring memorable performances by Tom Berenger, Glenn Close, Jeff Goldblum, William Hurt, Kevin Kline, Mary Kay Place, Meg Tilly, and JoBeth Williams. And with its playlist of sixties rock and R&B hits,The Big Chillall but invented the consummately curated soundtrack.",Lawrence Kasdan,United States,1983,English,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/ace687c73ff2a89b78e73f7ed313e796/2H53DXvnDSCbuN3PlD0MhvPBtWLagJ_large.jpg,0085244

With remarkable sensitivity and attention to the details of everyday working-class life, Ray builds a powerful human drama that is at once a hopeful morality tale and a commentary on the identity of the modern Indian woman.",Satyajit Ray,India,1963,Bengali,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/ebb3e6ce6778a7c588010b39cba076a8/GQbiSaCYwPh6PwpaBE6DWBLzID0Aqc_large.jpg,0057277
110,BIGGER THAN LIFE,"Though ignored at the time of its release, Nicholas Ray’sBigger Than Lifeis now recognized as one of the great American films of the 1950s. When a friendly, successful suburban teacher and father (James Mason, in one of his most indelible roles) is prescribed cortisone for a painful, possibly fatal affliction, he grows dangerously addicted to the experimental drug, resulting in his transformation into a psychotic and ultimately violent household despot. This Eisenhower-era throat-grabber, shot in expressive CinemaScope, is an excoriating take on the nuclear family. That it came in the day ofFather Knows Bestmakes it all the more shocking—and wildly entertaining.",Nicholas Ray,United States,1956,English,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/d4d406ae48cd0fbfc78216e2efb5bf43/NEeX7phTkN3xjrd1deXb0RmokIXDG3_large.jpg,0049010
111,BILLY LIAR,"Tom Courtenay gives a flawlessly nuanced performance as Billy Fisher, the underachieving undertaker’s assistant whose constant daydreams and truth-deficient stories earn him the nickname “Billy Liar.” Julie Christie is the handbag-swinging charmer whose free spirit just might inspire Billy to finally move out of his parents’ house.

Both a socially conscious look at the hardships endured by underpaid field workers and a melodrama tinged with sex and violence, this early smash for producer extraordinaire Dino De Laurentiis and director Giuseppe De Santis is neorealism with a heaping dose of pulp.",Giuseppe De Santis,Italy,1949,Italian,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/44724b2a46d8cbc9f6b98b1ac74c8850/F1uKG1iHKWWhULZJUiVUZ1iuE0kjHv_large.jpg,0040737
113,THE BITTER TEARS OF PETRA VON KANT,"In the early 1970s, Rainer Werner Fassbinder discovered the American melodramas of Douglas Sirk and was inspired by them to begin working in a new, more intensely emotional register. One of the first and best-loved films of this period in his career isThe Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant,which balances a realistic depiction of tormented romance with staging that remains true to the director’s roots in experimental theater. This unforgettable, unforgiving dissection of the imbalanced relationship between a haughty fashion designer (Margit Carstensen) and a beautiful but icy ingenue (Hanna Schygulla)—based, in a sly gender reversal, on the writer-director’s own desperate obsession with a young actor—is a true Fassbinder affair, featuring exquisitely claustrophobic cinematography by Michael Ballhaus and full-throttle performances by an all-female cast.",Rainer Werner Fassbinder,West Germany,1972,German,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/4e79a1eff1b5b8650d9aa0a87f12b219/LAa9Dc6FFaSoBp08XqpUl1VNMbGHJy_large.jpg,0068278
125,BLIND CHANCE,"Before he stunned the cinematic world with the epic seriesThe Decalogueand theThree Colorstrilogy, the great Polish filmmaker Krzysztof Kieślowski made his first work of metaphysical genius,Blind Chance,a compelling drama about the difficulty of reconciling political ideals with personal happiness. This unforgettable film follows Witek (the magnetic Bogusław Linda), a medical student with an uncertain future in Communist Poland; Kieślowski dramatizes Witek’s journey as a series of different possibilities, suggesting that chance rules our lives as much as choice does. First suppressed and then censored by the Polish government,Blind Chanceis here presented in its complete original form.",Krzysztof Kieślowski,Poland,1981,Polish,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/5e6aa9641e638740a44bb264f1355f96/1oPdGoEjOgaCuzl3tIggXjMtiezIY8_large.jpg,0084549
152,BREAKING THE WAVES,"Lars von Trier became an international sensation with this galvanizing realist fable about sex and spiritual transcendence. In an Oscar-nominated performance, Emily Watson stuns as Bess, a simple, pious newlywed in a tiny Scottish village who gives herself up to a shocking form of martyrdom after her husband (Stellan Skarsgård) is paralyzed in an oil rig accident.Breaking the Waves,both brazen and tender, profane and pure, is an examination of the expansiveness of faith and of its limits.",Lars von Trier,Denmark,1996,English,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/a242b187954f20bec51b46bb3b6394e0/naJ4pElFOMtxFju1bwGfTJfFeY496g_large.jpg,0115751
114,BLACK GIRL,"Ousmane Sembène was one of the greatest and most groundbreaking filmmakers who ever lived, as well as the most renowned African director of the twentieth century—and yet his name still deserves to be better known in the rest of the world. He made his feature debut in 1966 with the brilliant and stirringBlack Girl.Sembène, who was also an acclaimed novelist in his native Senegal, transforms a deceptively simple plot—about a young Senegalese woman who moves to France to work for a wealthy white family and finds that life in their small apartment becomes a prison, both figuratively and literally—into a complexly layered critique of the lingering colonialist mind-set of a supposedly postcolonial world. Featuring a moving central performance by M’Bissine Thérèse Diop,Black Girlis a harrowing human drama as well as a radical political statement—and one of the essential films of the 1960s.Black Girlwas restored by the Cineteca di Bologna/L’Immagine Ritrovata laboratory, in association with the Sembène Estate; INA, Institut National de l’Audiovisuel; Éclair; and the Centre National de Cinématographie.

After skirting the horrors of a mysterious war being waged in the countryside, beautiful young Lily (Cathryn Harrison) takes refuge in a remote farmhouse, where she becomes embroiled in the surreal domestic life of an extremely unconventional family. Evocatively shot by cinematographer Sven Nykvist,Black Moonis a Freudian tale of adolescent sexuality set in a postapocalyptic world of shifting identities and talking animals.

116,BLACK NARCISSUS,"This explosive work about the conflict between the spirit and the flesh is the epitome of the sensuous style of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger. A group of nuns—played by some of Britain’s finest actresses, including Deborah Kerr, Kathleen Byron, and Flora Robson—struggle to establish a convent in the Himalayas, while isolation, extreme weather, altitude, and culture clashes all conspire to drive the well-intentioned missionaries mad.

From the crystalline shores of a deserted island to the green grass and dusty roads of 1940s suburban America, Ballard and director of photography Caleb Deschanel create a film of consistent visual invention and purity, one that also features a winning supporting performance by Mickey Rooney as a retired jockey and a gorgeous score by Carmine Coppola.",Carroll Ballard,United States,1979,English,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/f7bec3e6786018d661936d975b64e1b1/H74UdarqxqNyFJZFdDG3KOTE05Vcve_large.jpg,0078872
121,BLACK SUN,"You’ve probably never seen anything quite like this manic, oddball, anti–buddy picture about a young, jazz-obsessed Japanese drifter and a black American GI on the lam in Tokyo.

123,LES BLANK: ALWAYS FOR PLEASURE,"An uncompromisingly independent filmmaker, Les Blank made documentaries for nearly fifty years, elegantly disappearing with his camera into cultural spots rarely seen on-screen—mostly on the peripheries of the United States, but also occasionally abroad. Seemingly off-the-cuff yet poetically constructed, these films are humane, sometimes wry, always engaging tributes to music, food, and all sorts of regionally specific delights.

124,BLAST OF SILENCE,"Swift, brutal, and black-hearted, Allen Baron''s New York City noirBlast of Silenceis a sensational surprise. This low-budget, carefully crafted portrait of a hit man on assignment in Manhattan during Christmastime follows its stripped-down narrative with mechanical precision, yet also with an eye and ear for the oddball idiosyncrasies of urban living and the imposing beauty of the city. At once visually ragged and artfully composed, and featuring rough, poetic narration performed by Lionel Stander,Blast of Silenceis a stylish triumph.",Allen Baron,United States,1961,English,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/2817715fcf9440573782a4174f23ab80/bKDtbQOKDfNuRMNeMHo5iM9rOKZXZ1_large.jpg,0054687
126,BLITHE SPIRIT,"Blithe Spirit,David Lean’s delightful film version of Noël Coward’s theater sensation (onstage, it broke London box-office records before hitting Broadway), stars Rex Harrison as a novelist who cheekily invites a medium (Margaret Rutherford) to his house to conduct a séance, hoping the experience will inspire a book he’s working on. Things go decidedly not as planned when she summons the spirit of his dead first wife (Kay Hammond), a severe inconvenience for his current one (Constance Cummings).

128,BLONDE VENUS,"Josef von Sternberg returned Marlene Dietrich to the stage inBlonde Venus,both a glittering spectacle and a sweeping melodrama about motherly devotion. Unfolding episodically, the film tells the story of Helen (Dietrich), once a German chanteuse, now an American housewife, who resurrects her stage career after her husband (Herbert Marshall) falls ill; she then becomes the mistress of a millionaire (Cary Grant), in a slide from loving martyr to dishonored woman.

Actor M. Emmet Walsh looms over the proceedings as a slippery private eye with a yellow suit, a cowboy hat, and no moral compass, and Frances McDormand’s cunning debut performance set her on the road to stardom. The tight scripting and inventive style that have marked the Coens’ work for decades are all here in their first film, in which cinematographer Barry Sonnenfeld abandons black-and-white chiaroscuro for neon signs and jukebox colors that combine with Carter Burwell’s haunting score to lurid and thrilling effect.

A countercultural masterpiece about the act of seeing and the art of image making,Blow-Uptakes the form of a psychological mystery, starring David Hemmings as a fashion photographer who unknowingly captures a death on film after following two lovers in a park. Antonioni’s meticulous aesthetic control and intoxicating color palette breathe life into every frame, and the jazzy sounds of Herbie Hancock, a beautifully evasive performance by Vanessa Redgrave, and a cameo by the Yardbirds make the film a transporting time capsule from a bygone era.Blow-Upis a seductive immersion into creative passion, and a brilliant film by one of cinema’s greatest artists.",Michelangelo Antonioni,United Kingdom,1966,English,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/83e5df1cf7966e4e5392de109198023c/vmS4CDfnJ0R6Qu3O4P0ud3FMrjlc29_large.jpg,0060176

138,BODY AND SOUL,"Although the 1920s brought him acclaim as a stage actor and singer, Paul Robeson still had to prove himself as a viable screen performer. Mainstream avenues were limited, however, and his first films were made on the peripheries of the film business.Body and Soul, directed by the legendary African American filmmaker Oscar Micheaux, is a direct critique of the power of the cloth, casting Robeson in dual roles as a jackleg preacher and a well-meaning inventor.",Oscar Micheaux,United States,1925,English,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/e8c19690806d171f7e3ef5c667737ca9/v6zAyHvnNeorIDi62bcCZ2NTMmOwHJ_large.jpg,5607714

The Lestingois family decides to take in the irrepressible bum, and he shows his gratitude by shaking the household to its foundations.

159,BROADCAST NEWS,"Since the 1970s, the name James L. Brooks has been synonymous with intelligent television comedy—his shows are insightful about work and love and always plugged in to the zeitgeist. He is also a master storyteller of the big screen, and none of his films was more quintessentially Brooks thanBroadcast News. This caustic look inside the Washington news media stars Holly Hunter, in her breakout role, as a feisty television producer torn between an ambitious yet dim anchorman (William Hurt) and her closest confidant, a cynical veteran reporter (Albert Brooks).

Meanwhile, her five-year-old daughter, under the care of her estranged husband, is being terrorized by a group of demonic beings. How these two story lines connect is the shocking and grotesque secret of this bloody tale of monstrous parenthood from David Cronenberg, starring Oliver Reed and Samantha Eggar. With its combination of psychological and body horror,The Broodlaid the groundwork for many of the director’s films to come, but it stands on its own as a personal, singularly scary vision.",David Cronenberg,Canada,1979,English,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/67117ef4c14c1b171cf20186e13bfea3/tYorJIGBw69oRh3kTdEFeihVzDUy7M_large.jpg,0078908
161,THE BROWNING VERSION,"Michael Redgrave gives the performance of his career in Anthony Asquith’s adaptation of Terence Rattigan’s unforgettable play. Redgrave portrays Andrew Crocker-Harris, an embittered, middle-aged schoolmaster who begins to feel that his life has been a failure. Diminished by poor health, a crumbling marriage, and the derision of his pupils, the once brilliant scholar is compelled to reexamine his life when a young student offers an unexpected gesture of kindness.

162,BRUTE FORCE,"As hard-hitting as its title,Brute Forcewas the first of Jules Dassin’s forays into the crime genre, a prison melodrama that takes a critical look at American society as well. Burt Lancaster is the timeworn Joe Collins, who, along with his fellow inmates, lives under the heavy thumb of the sadistic, power-tripping guard Captain Munsey (a riveting Hume Cronyn). Only Collins’s dreams of escape keep him going, but how can he possibly bust out of Munsey’s chains?

In the wake of this success, director Wim Wenders filmed the ensemble’s members—including golden-voiced Ibrahim Ferrer and piano virtuoso Rubén González—in a series of illuminating interviews and live performances.

Documentary filmmaker Les Blank captured the unfolding of this production, made more perilous by Herzog’s determination to shoot the most daunting scenes without models or special effects, including a sequence requiring hundreds of indigenous Peruvians to pull a full-size, 320-ton steamship over a small mountain.

What seems at first to be a straightforward tale of two people—played by Oscar-winning actress Juliette Binoche and opera singer William Shimell—getting to know each other over the course of an afternoon gradually reveals itself as something richer, stranger, and trickier: a mind-bending reflection on authenticity, in art as well as in relationships.

196,LA CHIENNE,"Jean Renoir’s ruthless love triangle tale, his second sound film, is a true precursor to his brilliantly bitterThe Rules of the Game,displaying all of the filmmaker’s visual genius and fully imbued with his profound humanity. Michel Simon cuts a tragic figure as an unhappily married cashier and amateur painter who becomes so smitten with a prostitute that he refuses to see the obvious: that she and her pimp boyfriend are taking advantage of him.

199,CHIMES AT MIDNIGHT,"The crowning achievement of Orson Welles’s extraordinary cinematic career,Chimes at Midnightwas the culmination of the filmmaker’s lifelong obsession with Shakespeare’s ultimate rapscallion, Sir John Falstaff. Usually a comic supporting figure, Falstaff—the loyal, often soused friend of King Henry IV’s wayward son Prince Hal—here becomes the focus: a robustly funny and ultimately tragic screen antihero played by Welles with looming, lumbering grace. Integrating elements from bothHenry IVplays as well asRichard II, Henry V,andThe Merry Wives of Windsor,Welles created a gritty and unorthodox Shakespeare film as a lament, he said, “for the death of Merrie England.” Poetic, philosophical, and visceral—with a kinetic centerpiece battle sequence that rivals anything in the director’s body of work—Chimes at Midnightis as monumental as the figure at its heart.",Orson Welles,Spain,1966,English,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/1412d8b36b09381acde385c859f42cac/vVWYoiTPW7D4hf0mZN6yOsJEJ3wXsD_large.jpg,0059012

That simple family reunion setup, however, can’t begin to describe the unpredictable, emotionally volatile experience of this film, an inventive, magical drama that’s equal parts merriment and melancholy.

Simply by interviewing a group of Paris residents in the summer of 1960—beginning with the provocative and eternal question “Are you happy?” and expanding to political issues, including the ongoing Algerian War—Rouch and Morin reveal the hopes and dreams of a wide array of people, from artists to factory workers, from an Italian émigré to an African student.Chronicle of a Summer’s penetrative approach   gives us a document of a     time    and place with extraordinary emotional depth.",Jean Rouch and Edgar Morin,France,1961,French,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/19a13fee4205abbab350e818ceaef9c3/6CUw6ARal1JEISPxk7DB0LGDi9REPd_large.jpg,14176542

With a radical and disturbing take on narrative, beautiful cinematography, and a highly sophisticated use of on- and offscreen sound, Martel turns her tale of a dissolute bourgeois extended family, whiling away the hours of one sweaty, sticky summer, into a cinematic marvel. This visceral take on class, nature, sexuality, and the ways that political turmoil and social stagnation can manifest in human relationships is a drama of extraordinary tactility, and one of the great contemporary film debuts.",Lucrecia Martel,Argentina,2001,Spanish,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/1c5fca8c40bb66746852edac6075a4c4/bfd4HXVR74XrJEepgJMYmJRi7zvIv7_large.jpg,0240419
205,THE CIRCUS,"In the last film he made during the silent era, Charlie Chaplin revels in the art of the circus, paying tribute to the acrobats and pantomimists who inspired his virtuoso pratfalls. After being mistaken for a pickpocket, Chaplin’s Tramp flees into the ring of a traveling circus and soon becomes the star of the show, falling for the troupe’s bareback rider along the way. Despite its famously troubled production, this gag-packed comedy ranks among Chaplin’s finest, thanks to some of the most audacious set pieces of the director-performer’s career, including a close brush with a lion and a climactic tightrope walk with a barrelful of monkeys.The Circus,which was rereleased in 1969 with a new score by Chaplin, is an uproarious high-wire act that showcases silent cinema’s most popular entertainer at the peak of his comic powers.",Charles Chaplin,United States,1928,Silent,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/e47f71ec6b32e658b605b0597069d746/mb6Gef7oSB6XGh8TMxthVmUFHIWMtb_large.jpg,0018773

The writer-director-star achieved new levels of grace, in both physical comedy and dramatic poignancy, with this silent tale of a lovable vagrant falling for a young blind woman who sells flowers on the street (a magical Virginia Cherrill) and mistakes him for a millionaire. Though this Depression-era smash was made after the advent of sound, Chaplin remained steadfast in his love for the expressive beauty of the pre-talkie form. The result was the epitome of his art and the crowning achievement of silent comedy.",Charles Chaplin,United States,1931,English,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/9eb1d91e3a6e2bea22bdd915501aa980/WZ6I1ffhyQomwmWUH54lJ1JgY7StqV_large.jpg,0021749

Before then, Jerôme spends his July at a lakeside boardinghouse nursing crushes on the sixteen-year-old Laura and, more tantalizingly, Laura’s long-legged, blonde stepsister, Claire. Baring her knee on a ladder under a blooming cherry tree, Claire unwittingly instigates Jerôme’s moral crisis and creates both one of French cinema’s most enduring moments and what has become the iconic image of Rohmer’s Moral Tales.",Eric Rohmer,France,1970,French,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/ebbc54006d2827f0f3b4daeabea8a2dd/fS0eeoVFUFHT7qsGCOQR4dXtsuMcUX_large.jpg,0065772

She watches helplessly as her own hopes and desires are pushed aside time and again by those of her siblings and parents, until all her chances for happiness evaporate, leaving her crushed and ailing. Experimenting with off-balance compositions, discontinuous editing, and a densely layered soundtrack, Ghatak devised an intellectually ambitious and emotionally devastating new shape for the melodrama, lamenting the tragedies of Indian history and the inequities of traditional gender roles while blazing a formal trail for the generations of Indian filmmakers who have followed him.The Cloud-Capped Starwas restored in partnership with The Film Foundation’s World Cinema Project and the Cineteca di Bologna, from elements preserved by the National Film Archive of India.",Ritwik Ghatak,India,1960,Bengali,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/0d34ca286207fc28d93c5b50c0ec88ec/M7b316Dur9REofyRicy2Yd2DkDyNVT_large.jpg,0054073
214,CLOUDS OF SILS MARIA,"This multilayered, immensely entertaining drama from the great contemporary French director Olivier Assayas is a singular look at the intersection of high art and popular culture. The always extraordinary Juliette Binoche is stirring as Maria, a stage and screen icon who is being courted to star in a new production of the play that made her famous—only this time she must assume the role of the older woman. Kristen Stewart matches her punch for punch as her beleaguered assistant, called upon to provide support both professional and emotional for her mercurial boss. And Chloë Grace Moretz is Maria’s callow new castmate, a starlet waiting in the wings.

215,CLUNY BROWN,"The final film completed by Ernst Lubitsch, this zany, zippy comedy of manners, set in England on the cusp of World War II, is one of the worldly-wise director’s most effervescent creations. Jennifer Jones shines in a rare comedic turn as Cluny Brown, an irrepressible heroine with a zeal for plumbing. Sent to work as a parlormaid at a stuffy country manor, she proceeds to turn the household upside down—with plenty of help from Adam Belinski (Charles Boyer), an eccentric Continental exile who has fled the Nazis but is still worried about where his next meal is coming from. Sending up British class hierarchy with Lubitsch’s famously light touch,Cluny Brownis a topsy-turvy farce that says nuts to the squirrels and squirrels to the nuts.",Ernst Lubitsch,United States,1946,English,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/70e6c5bc30a6ed381e5d4d0683bec561/6bFWIQhM625dDBlb8pwoRt3svKDhP7_large.jpg,0038419

His dramaCode Unknown,the first of his many films made in France, may be his most inspired work. Composed almost entirely of brilliantly shot, single-take vignettes focusing on characters connected to one seemingly minor incident on a Paris street, Haneke’s film—with an outstanding international cast headlined by Juliette Binoche—is a revelatory examination of racial inequality and the failure of communication in an increasingly diverse modern landscape.",Michael Haneke,France,2000,French,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/30daee31292de8db91830c2a79adf77a/kihEuMOqFVz1nRi8UVU6K8vJuIlNAl_large.jpg,0216625

Over the next fifteen years, their turbulent relationship will play out in stolen moments between the jazz clubs of decadent bohemian Paris, to which he escapes, and the corrupt, repressive Communist Bloc, where she remains—universes bridged by their passion for music and for each other. Photographed in luscious monochrome and suffused with the melancholy of the simple folk song that provides a motif for the couple’s fateful affair, Pawlikowski’s timeless story—inspired by that of his own parents—is a heart-stoppingly grand vision of star-crossed love caught up in the tide of history.",Paweł Pawlikowski,Poland,2018,"Polish,                                          French,                                          Russian,                                          Croatian,                                          Italian,                                          German",https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/8e408093cb123fc9125296bc8070af93/tT6PfuYCu8xygovqNWWfkBbAo0RrDU_large.jpg,6543652
218,COLD WATER,"An acclaimed early work by Olivier Assayas, the long-unavailable, deeply felt coming-of-age dramaCold Watercan at last be seen in the United States. Drawing from his own youthful experiences, Assayas revisits the outskirts of Paris in the early 1970s, telling the story of teenage lovers Gilles (Cyprien Fouquet) and Christine (Virginie Ledoyen), whose rebellions against family and society threaten to tear them apart. The visceral realism of the movie’s narrative and the near experimentalism of its camera work come together effortlessly thanks in part to a rock soundtrack that vividly evokes the period.Cold Water,whose centerpiece is one of the most memorable party sequences ever committed to film, is a heartbreaking immersion in the emotional tumult of being young.",Olivier Assayas,France,1994,French,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/7dc2053676e3548a6a4e024bc46a509d/s6RMaPtpFDn6RCemQ507uIvhkmRm6v_large.jpg,0109702

220,THE COLOR OF POMEGRANATES,"A breathtaking fusion of poetry, ethnography, and cinema, Sergei Parajanov’s masterwork overflows with unforgettable images and sounds. In a series of tableaux that blend the tactile with the abstract,The Color of Pomegranatesrevives the splendors of Armenian culture through the story of the eighteenth-century troubadour Sayat-Nova, charting his intellectual, artistic, and spiritual growth through iconographic compositions rather than traditional narrative. The film’s tapestry of folklore and metaphor departed from the realism that dominated the Soviet cinema of its era, leading authorities to block its distribution, with rare underground screenings presenting it in a restructured form. This edition features the cut closest to Parajanov’s original vision, in a restoration that brings new life to one of cinema’s most enigmatic meditations on art and beauty.The Color of Pomegranateswas restored by The Film Foundation’s World Cinema Project and the Cineteca di Bologna, in association with the National Cinema Centre of Armenia and Gosfilmofond of Russia, and funded by the Material World Charitable Foundation.",Sergei Parajanov,Soviet Union,1969,"Armenian,                                          Georgian",https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/0972e94eb6deb7848c417d7ac83c1efb/thoVlhVudcPZcmdyX8qfGrIFKFByDg_large.jpg,0063555

An irreverent paean to the prosaic craft of cinema as well as a delightful human comedy about the pitfalls of sex and romance,Day for Nightis buoyed by robust performances and a sparkling score by the legendary Georges Delerue.",François Truffaut,France,1973,French,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/7667c4229e57db415f4b05c81d07da43/AnZ260N6qfjN3t5vWZvfLYZv2PcaoB_large.jpg,0070460
252,A DAY IN THE COUNTRY,"This bittersweet film from Jean Renoir, based on a story by Guy de Maupassant, is a tenderly comic idyll about a city family’s picnic in the French countryside and the romancing of the mother and grown daughter by two local men. Conceived as a short feature, the project had nearly finished production in 1936 when Renoir was called away forThe Lower Depths.Shooting was abandoned then, but the film was completed with the existing footage by Renoir’s team and released in its current form in 1946, after the director had already moved on to Hollywood. The result is a warmly humanist vignette that ranks among Renoir’s most lyrical works, with a love for nature imbuing its every beautiful frame.",Jean Renoir,France,1936,French,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/044a5a0a2a7125f0b809350ef96d01cb/9XiTwMSfnaq7GPsxhyA814NRNc5tgN_large.jpg,3224458
253,DAY OF WRATH,"Filmed during the Nazi occupation of Denmark, Carl Dreyer’sDay of Wrath(Vredens dag) is a harrowing account of individual helplessness in the face of growing social repression and paranoia. Anna, the young second wife of a well-respected but much older pastor, falls in love with her stepson when he returns to their small seventeenth-century village.

254,DAYS OF HEAVEN,"One-of-a-kind filmmaker-philosopher Terrence Malick has created some of the most visually arresting films of the twentieth century, and his glorious period tragedyDays of Heaven,featuring Oscar-winning cinematography by Nestor Almendros, stands out among them. In 1910, a Chicago steelworker (Richard Gere) accidentally kills his supervisor, and he, his girlfriend (Brooke Adams), and his little sister (Linda Manz) flee to the Texas panhandle, where they find work harvesting wheat in the fields of a stoic farmer (Sam Shepard).

255,THE DAYTRIPPERS,"With its droll humor and bittersweet emotional heft, the feature debut of writer-director Greg Mottola announced the arrival of an unassumingly sharp-witted new talent on the 1990s indie film scene. When she discovers a love letter written to her husband (Stanley Tucci) by an unknown paramour, the distraught Eliza (Hope Davis) turns to her tight-knit Long Island family for advice. Soon the entire clan—strong-willed mom (Anne Meara), taciturn dad (Pat McNamara), and jaded sister (Parker Posey) with pretentious boyfriend (Liev Schreiber) in tow—has squeezed into a station wagon and headed into Manhattan to find out the truth, kicking off a one-crazy-day odyssey full of unexpected detours and life-changing revelations.

Among the best teen films ever made, Richard Linklater’sDazed and Confusedeavesdrops on a group of seniors-to-be and incoming freshmen. A launching pad for a number of future stars, Linklater’s first studio effort also features endlessly quotable dialogue and a blasting, stadium-ready soundtrack. Sidestepping nostalgia,Dazed and Confusedis less about “the best years of our lives” than the boredom, angst, and excitement of teenagers waiting . . . for something to happen.",Richard Linklater,United States,1993,English,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/406c5bfd8089fa0d386cb7bdc5850df9/EdQqw8cU4kk7owg1vm6AUfvvV8Fju8_large.jpg,0106677
257,DEAD MAN,"WithDead Man,his first period piece, Jim Jarmusch imagined the nineteenth-century American West as an existential wasteland, delivering a surreal reckoning with the ravages of industrialization, the country’s legacy of violence and prejudice, and the natural cycle of life and death. Accountant William Blake (Johnny Depp) has hardly arrived in the godforsaken outpost of Machine before he’s caught in the middle of a fatal lovers’ quarrel. Wounded and on the lam, Blake falls under the watch of the outcast Nobody (Gary Farmer), who guides his companion on a spiritual journey, teaching him to dispense poetic justice along the way.

258,DEAD RINGERS,"InDead Ringers, David Cronenberg tells the chilling story of identical twin gynecologists—suave Elliot and sensitive Beverly, bipolar sides of one personality—who share the same practice, the same apartment, the same women.

260,DEATH IN VENICE,"Based on the classic novella by Thomas Mann, this late-career masterpiece from Luchino Visconti is a meditation on the nature of art, the allure of beauty, and the inescapability of death. A fastidious composer reeling from a disastrous concert, Gustav von Aschenbach (Dirk Bogarde, in an exquisitely nuanced performance) travels to Venice to recover. There, he is struck by a vision of pure beauty in the form of a young boy named Tadzio (Björn Andrésen), his infatuation developing into an obsession even as rumors of a plague spread through the city. Setting Mann’s story of queer desire and bodily decay against the sublime music of Gustav Mahler,Death in Veniceis one of cinema’s most exalted literary adaptations, as sensually rich as it is allegorically resonant.",Luchino Visconti,Italy,1971,English,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/6fb38dd82b9187c02eefe787d4b50a26/6Sih2y6NRUfuPxa5MOSpbNEim3ydUM_large.jpg,0067445

The resulting, exquisitely shot tale of guilt, infidelity, and blackmail reveals the wide gap between the rich and the poor in Spain, and surveys the corrupt ethics of a society seduced by decadence. Juan Antonio Bardem''s charged melodramaDeath of a Cyclist(Muerte de un ciclista) was a direct attack on 1950s Spanish society under Franco’s rule.

Among the chief delights are a young man’s exploits with a gang of grave robbers, a flock of randy nuns who sin with a strapping gardener, and Pasolini’s appearance as a pupil of the painter Giotto, at work on a massive fresco.

Originally made for Polish television,Dekalogfocuses on the residents of a housing complex in late-Communist Poland, whose lives become subtly intertwined as they face emotional dilemmas that are at once deeply personal and universally human. Its ten hour-long films, drawing from the Ten Commandments for thematic inspiration and an overarching structure, grapple deftly with complex moral and existential questions concerning life, death, love, hate, truth, and the passage of time. Shot by nine different cinematographers, with stirring music by Zbigniew Preisner and compelling performances from established and unknown actors alike,Dekalogarrestingly explores the unknowable forces that shape our lives.

The devil (Stig Järrel)suffers from an inflamed eye, which he informs Don Juan (Jarl Kulle) can be cured only if a young woman’s chastity is breached. So the legendary lover ascends from hell and sets about seducing an innocent pastor’s daughter, Britt-Marie (Bibi Andersson). Bergman’s dialogue bubbles with an irony reminiscent of his beloved Molière, and the music of Domenico Scarlatti (performed by Bergman’s fourth wife, Käbi Laretei) underscores the joy that infuses much of the film.",Ingmar Bergman,Sweden,1960,Swedish,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/2b90161ea5506de4d1960e99dc7218d6/eNPsJqxJmUlYIXJFxdeZzgjXavDdbf_large.jpg,0053772

268,DETOUR,"From Poverty Row came a movie that, perhaps more than any other, epitomizes the dark fatalism at the heart of film noir. As he hitchhikes his way from New York to Los Angeles, a down-on-his-luck nightclub pianist (Tom Neal) finds himself with a dead body on his hands and nowhere to run—a waking nightmare that goes from bad to worse when he picks up the most vicious femme fatale in cinema history, Ann Savage’s snarling, monstrously conniving drifter Vera.

As the makeshift family embarks on a new life,Dheepansettles into an intimate social-realist mode before tightening into a dynamic turf-war thriller, as well as an unsettling study of the psychological aftereffects of combat.

Along with visceral camera work by Jaroslav Kučera and Miroslav Ondříček—two of Czechoslovak cinema’s most influential cinematographers—Němec makes inventive use of fractured editing, elliptical storytelling, and flights of surrealism as he strips context away from this bare-bones tale, evoking the panicked delirium of consciousness lost in night and fog.",Jan Němec,Czechoslovakia,1964,"Czech,                                          German",https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/846782a86f974677f8cc1565cd78d567/JXbgXFlzpc3Icnzi3hvX8Ftsto3q0Q_large.jpg,0058001

Yet as desperate as their circumstances are, each of them—the homeless father and son envisioning their dream house; the young woman abused by her uncle; the boy who imagines himself a trolley conductor—finds reasons to carry on.

286,LA DOLCE VITA,"The biggest hit from the most popular Italian filmmaker of all time,La dolce vitarocketed Federico Fellini to international mainstream success—ironically, by offering a damning critique of the culture of stardom. A look at the darkness beneath the seductive lifestyles of Rome’s rich and glamorous, the film follows a notorious celebrity journalist (a sublimely cool Marcello Mastroianni) during a hectic week spent on the peripheries of the spotlight. This mordant picture was an incisive commentary on the deepening decadence of contemporary Europe, and it provided a prescient glimpse of just how gossip- and fame-obsessed our society would become.",Federico Fellini,Italy,1960,Italian,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/41271853307b3fb10334a7d2b51e41ce/pDxTYardFcKk8EIL1qgmAJ96A9zCTn_large.jpg,0053779

In this wildly entertaining vision of one of the twentieth century’s greatest artists, Dylan is surrounded by teen fans, gets into heated philosophical jousts with journalists, and kicks back with fellow musicians Joan Baez, Donovan, and Alan Price. Featuring some of Dylan’s most famous songs, including “Subterranean Homesick Blues,” “The Times They Are A-Changin’,” and “It’s All Over Now, Baby Blue,”Dont Look Backis a radically conceived portrait of an American icon that has influenced decades of vérité behind-the-scenes documentaries.",D.

Though unknown to each other, the two women share an enigmatic, emotional bond, which Kieślowski details in gorgeous reflections, colors, and movements.

297,DOWNHILL RACER,"Astonishing Alpine location photography and a young Robert Redford in one of his earliest starring roles are just two of the visual splendors ofDownhill Racer,the visceral debut feature of Michael Ritchie. In a beautifully understated performance, Redford is David Chappellet, a ruthlessly ambitious skier competing for Olympic gold with an underdog American team in Europe, and Gene Hackman provides tough support as the coach who tries to temper the upstart’s narcissistic drive for glory.

302,"DRIVE, HE SAID","Fresh off of hisFive Easy Piecessuccess, Jack Nicholson mounted his enormously irreverent directorial debut. Based on the best-selling novel by Jeremy Larner,Drive, He Said,free-spirited and sobering by turns, is a sketch of the exploits of a disaffected college basketball player (William Tepper) and his increasingly radical roommate (Michael Margotta), as well as a feverishly shot and edited snapshot of the early seventies (some of it was filmed during an actual campus protest).

303,"DR. STRANGELOVE, OR: HOW I LEARNED TO STOP WORRYING AND LOVE THE BOMB","Stanley Kubrick’s painfully funny take on Cold War anxiety is one of the fiercest satires of human folly ever to come out of Hollywood. The matchless shape-shifter Peter Sellers plays three wildly different roles: Royal Air Force Captain Lionel Mandrake, timidly trying to stop a nuclear attack on the USSR ordered by an unbalanced general (Sterling Hayden); the ineffectual and perpetually dumbfounded U.S. President Merkin Muffley, who must deliver the very bad news to the Soviet premier; and the titular Strangelove himself, a wheelchair-bound presidential adviser with a Nazi past. Finding improbable hilarity in nearly every unimaginable scenario,Dr. Strangelove, or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bombis a subversive masterpiece that officially announced Kubrick as an unparalleled stylist and pitch-black ironist.",Stanley Kubrick,"United States,                                              United Kingdom",1964,English,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/0a9d8cafec1031c98436007b77553d6f/8RnJTFRJr7Ho5oNBlduI3C9erCpY1t_large.jpg,0057012

Protected by a friendly British officer (Roger Livesey) and his wife (Valerie Hobson), and befriended by the regiment’s drummer boy, Prince Azim ends up fighting with the colonialists against his dastardly uncle.

306,DRY SUMMER,"Winner of the prestigious Golden Bear at the 1964 Berlin International Film Festival, Metin Erksan’s wallop of a melodrama follows the machinations of an unrepentantly selfish tobacco farmer who builds a dam to prevent water from flowing downhill to his neighbors’ crops. Alongside this tale of soul-devouring competition is one of overheated desire, as a love triangle develops between the farmer, his more decent brother, and the beautiful villager the latter takes as his bride. A benchmark of Turkish cinema, this is a visceral, innovatively shot and vibrantly acted depiction of the horrors of greed.Dry Summerwas restored in 2008 by the Cineteca di Bologna/L’Immagine Ritrovata laboratory, in association with The Film Foundation’s World Cinema Project, Ulvi Dogan, and Fatih Akim.

307,A DRY WHITE SEASON,"With this bracing drama, made at the climax of the anti-apartheid movement, director Euzhan Palcy issued a devastating indict­ment of South Africa’s racist government—and made history in the process, becoming the first black woman to direct a Hollywood studio film. White schoolteacher Ben Du Toit (Donald Sutherland) lives in Johannesburg and remains blissfully incurious about the lives of his black countrymen until a wave of brutal treatment comes crashing down on his gardener (Winston Ntshona), bringing Du Toit face-to-face with harsh political realities. Based on a celebrated novel by André Brink and rooted in the first-hand research the Martinican Palcy did in South Africa into the way black people lived under apartheid,A Dry White Seasonis unflinching in its depiction of violence and its chronicling of injustice, making for a galvanizing tribute to those willing to sacrifice everything to fight oppression.",Euzhan Palcy,United States,1989,English,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/d3fa0bd2e5949b9e3c861222fb594d95/ASnRN4Kj6AdEv8RJTDrHKhIve2ZFQY_large.jpg,0097243

One night, by accident, they discover a way to simultaneously rid themselves of the “perverts” down the hall and realize their dream of opening a restaurant.

317,ELECTION,"Perky, overachieving high schooler Tracy Flick (Reese Witherspoon) gets on the nerves of social-studies teacher Jim McAllister (Matthew Broderick) to begin with, but after she launches her campaign for student-body president and his personal life starts to fall apart, things spiral out of control. In Alexander Payne’s satireElection,the teacher becomes unhealthily obsessed with cutting his student down to size, covertly backing a spoiler candidate to stop her from steamrolling to victory, and putting in motion a series of dirty tricks and reckless promises with uncanny real-world political parallels. Adapting a then-unpublished novel by Tom Perrotta, Payne grounds the absurdity of his central dynamic in the recognizable—the setting is his hometown of Omaha, Nebraska, and the accomplished cast is rounded out with nonprofessionals—and distills his closely observed take on deeply flawed humanity to its bitter but stealthily sympathetic essence.",Alexander Payne,United States,1999,English,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/a75129341a5da1a31ed6cb4617cd7d2f/3X4bhh4Dgc2xO8k6iNMMtpUfFrFi8w_large.jpg,0126886

The precise, minute detail with which Troell depicts the couple’s story—which is also that of countless other people who sought better lives across the Atlantic—is a wonder to behold.

He was already a legend for his stage incarnation of Brutus Jones, a Pullman porter who powers his way to the rule of a Caribbean island, but with this, his first sound-era film role, his regal image was married to his booming voice for eternity.

As caustic today as it was in 1963, this early collaboration between Luis García Berlanga and his longtime screenwriter Rafael Azcona is an unerring depiction of what Berlanga called “the invisible traps that society sets up for us.” A furiously funny personal attack on capital punishment,The Executionerevaded the state censors who sought to suppress it, and today is regarded as one of the greatest Spanish films of all time.",Luis García Berlanga,Spain,1963,Spanish,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/31c83f5d0b777c57c928236102cc1f8b/pFf5JOnCFkVDsc5hQGHCwODxzgaUy4_large.jpg,0057643

Directed by Elia Kazan from a screenplay by Budd Schulberg, this incisive satire features an extraordinary debut screen performance by Griffith, who brandishes his charm in an uncharacteristically sinister role.

With its eerie, coolly surreal cutout animation by Roland Topor; brilliant psychedelic jazz score by Alain Goraguer; and wondrous creatures and landscapes, this Cannes-awarded 1973 counterculture classic is a perennially compelling statement against conformity and violence.",René Laloux,"France,                                              Czechoslovakia",1973,French,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/3b384c601af6defbccd31020fb482b46/d5g8lS9xQQQyGpGaTma0HnkBycZvYo_large.jpg,0070544

Nearly a decade later—and after shooting a number of arresting dramas there and making the island his primary residence—the director set out to pay tribute to its inhabitants. InFårö Document,shot on handheld 16 mm by Sven Nykvist, Bergman interviews a variety of locals, in the process laying bare the generational divide between young residents eager to leave the island and older people more deeply rooted in bucolic tradition. The film revealed Bergman to be a sensitive and masterly documentarian.",Ingmar Bergman,Sweden,1970,Swedish,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/0e27c93443b2c941df7f3c213876b6ee/Gh295PdwTLrHs4VSSx9VcP5JskJmKI_large.jpg,0064355
353,FÅRÖ DOCUMENT 1979,"Midway through his time in Germany, Bergman returned to Fårö for his second documentary exploration of the remote Swedish island he loved and the socio­economic realities experienced by those who lived there. Longer, more optimistic, and less ascetic than its predecessor, this film charts a calendar year in the life of the island’s 673 inhabitants, many of whom he observes working tirelessly shearing sheep, thatching roofs, and slaughtering livestock, as well as going about various communal rituals. Distilled from twenty-eight hours of material,Fårö Document 1979is a lyrical depiction of life’s cyclical nature.",Ingmar Bergman,Sweden,1979,Swedish,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/cd3c7f927d0765f2eb4b7d90dd36cc43/qv2UEFstQfRJsOKQE614ECU0PGcLWN_large.jpg,0079187

Elena meets Fernando, an Italian law student; he seduces her with promises of love, and the ever-watchful Anaïs bears witness to the corruption of her sister’s innocence.Fat Girlis not only a portrayal of female adolescent sexuality and the complicated bond between siblings but also a shocking assertion by the always controversial Catherine Breillat that violent oppression exists at the core of male-female relations.",Catherine Breillat,France,2001,French,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/1e5cd8597637106d520f2598d6c30ac4/jD5LJNLBLglH8acNU9vzoGzVa6fUZv_large.jpg,0243255
355,FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS,"It is 1971, and journalist Raoul Duke barrels toward Las Vegas—accompanied by a trunkful of contraband and his slightly unhinged Samoan attorney, Dr. Gonzo—to cover a motorcycle race. What should be a cut-and-dried journalistic assignment quickly descends into a feverish psychedelic odyssey. Director Terry Gilliam and an all-star cast headlined by Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Toro show no mercy in bringing Hunter S.

357,FEMALE TROUBLE,"Glamour has never been more grotesque than inFemale Trouble,which injects the Hollywood melodrama with anarchic decadence. Divine, director John Waters’ larger-than-life muse, engulfs the screen with charisma as Dawn Davenport, the living embodiment of the film’s lurid mantra, “Crime is beauty,” who progresses from a teenage nightmare hell-bent on getting cha-cha heels for Christmas to a fame monster whose egomaniacal impulses land her in the electric chair. Shot in Waters’ native Baltimore on 16 mm, with a cast drawn from his beloved troupe of regulars, the Dreamlanders (including Mink Stole, David Lochary, Mary Vivian Pearce, Edith Massey, and Cookie Mueller), this film­—the director’s favorite of his work with Divine—comes to life through the tinsel-toned vision of production designer Vincent Peranio and costume designer/makeup artist Van Smith.

Beginning with portraits of the world- renowned art forger Elmyr de Hory and his equally devious biographer, Clifford Irving, Welles embarks on a dizzying journey that simultaneously exposes and revels in fakery and fakers of all stripes—not the least of whom is Welles himself.

383,THE FOUR FEATHERS,"This Technicolor spectacular, directed by Zoltán Korda, is considered the finest of the many adaptations of A. E. W. Mason’s classic 1902 adventure novel about the British empire’s exploits in Africa, and a crowning achievement of Alexander Korda’s legendary production company, London Films. Set at the end of the nineteenth century,The Four Feathersfollows the travails of a young officer (John Clements) accused of cowardice after he resigns his post on the eve of a major deployment to Khartoum; he must then fight to redeem himself in the eyes of his fellow officers (including Ralph Richardson) and fiancée (June Duprez).

384,FOX AND HIS FRIENDS,"A lottery win leads not to financial and emotional freedom but to social captivity, in this wildly cynical classic about love and exploitation by Rainer Werner Fassbinder. Casting himself against type, the director plays a suggestible working-class innocent who lets himself be taken advantage of by his bourgeois new boyfriend and his circle of materialistic friends, leading to the kind of resonant misery that only Fassbinder could create.Fox and His Friendsis unsparing social commentary, an amusingly pitiless and groundbreaking if controversial depiction of a gay community in 1970s West Germany.",Rainer Werner Fassbinder,Germany,1975,German,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/6c51980b28a026de3462f7102779dbc9/EUycN8XIb0CxWtbP6KEkEPtNUYQpfe_large.jpg,0072976

Jean Gabin plays the wily impresario Danglard, who makes the cancan all the rage while juggling the love of two beautiful women—an Egyptian belly-dancer and a naive working girl turned cancan star.

387,THE FRENCH LIEUTENANT’S WOMAN,"An astounding array of talent came together for the big-screen adaptation of John Fowles’s novelThe French Lieutenant’s Woman,a postmodern masterpiece that had been considered unfilmable. With an ingenious script by the Nobel Prize–winning playwright Harold Pinter, British New Wave trailblazer Karel Reisz transforms Fowles’s tale of scandalous romance into an arresting, hugely entertaining movie about cinema. In Pinter’s reimagining, Jeremy Irons and Meryl Streep star in parallel narratives, as a Victorian-era gentleman and the social outcast he risks everything to love, and as the contemporary actors playing those roles in a film production, and immersed in their own forbidden affair. Shot by the consummate cinematographer Freddie Francis and scored by the venerated composer and conductor Carl Davis, this is a beguiling, intellectually nimble feat of filmmaking, starring a pair of legendary actors in early leading roles.",Karel Reisz,United Kingdom,1981,English,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/9762df3989455ca24cd875d40725f202/fRIqrmeNWzN0xxfdXvd8vFM0gaAUAn_large.jpg,0082416
388,THE FRESHMAN,"Harold Lloyd’s biggest box-office hit was this silent comedy gem, featuring the befuddled everyman at his eager best as a new college student. Though he dreams of being a big man on campus, the freshman’s careful plans inevitably go hilariously awry, be it on the football field or at the Fall Frolic. But he gets a climactic chance to prove his mettle—and impress the sweet girl he loves—in one of the most famous sports sequences ever filmed. This crowd-pleaser is a gleeful showcase for Lloyd’s slapstick brilliance and incandescent charm, and it is accompanied here by a new orchestral score by Carl Davis.",Sam Taylor and Fred Newmeyer,United States,1925,English,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/cbda2b73d58c94da90d718beb2a6212f/grzsX7mRu1vFpl7oMh12x96ahSdYbj_large.jpg,0099615

Higgins’s acclaimed novelThe Friends of Eddie Coyle.World-weary and living hand to mouth, Coyle works on the sidelines of the seedy Boston underworld just to make ends meet. But when he finds himself facing a second stretch of hard time, he’s forced to weigh loyalty to his criminal colleagues against snitching to stay free.

390,FROM THE LIFE OF THE MARIONETTES,"Made during his self-imposed exile in Germany, Ingmar Bergman’sFrom the Life of the Marionettesoffers a lacerating portrait of a destructive marriage and a complex psychological analysis of a murder. Businessman Peter nurses fantasies of killing his wife, Katarina, until a prostitute becomes his surrogate prey. In the aftermath of the crime, Peter and Katarina’s psychiatrist and others attempt to explain its roots.

391,THE FUGITIVE KIND,"Four Oscar-winning actors—Marlon Brando, Anna Magnani, Joanne Woodward, and Maureen Stapleton—shine in this enthralling film, which also brings together the legendary talents of director Sidney Lumet and writer Tennessee Williams. A smoldering, snakeskin-jacketed Brando is Val Xavier, a drifter trying to go straight. He finds work and solace in a small-town southern variety store run by the married, sexually frustrated Lady Torrance (Magnani), who proves as much a temptation for Val as does local wild child Carol Cutrere (Woodward).

In a series of escalating “games,” the sadistic duo subject their victims to unspeakable physical and psychological torture over the course of a night. A home-invasion thriller in which the genre’s threat of bloodshed is made stomach-churningly real, the film ratchets up shocks even as its executioners interrupt the action to address the audience, drawing queasy attention to the way that cinema milks pleasure from pain and stokes our appetite for atrocity. With this controversial treatise on violence and entertainment, Haneke issued a summation of his cinematic philosophy, implicating his audience in a spectacle of unbearable cruelty.",Michael Haneke,Austria,1997,German,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/8a4b858980d60c264542454bf6c78fa6/4Wm5jDl9lBWMJo3UB6gBpNNQxfACdv_large.jpg,0808279

Thus begins a trip down the rabbit hole that is puzzling, terrifying, and exhilarating for Nicholas and viewers alike. This multilayered, noirish descent into one man’s personal hell is also a surreal, metacinematic journey that, two years after the phenomenonSe7en,further demonstrated that director David Fincher was one of Hollywood’s true contemporary visionaries.",David Fincher,United States,1997,English,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/693744d52bb74cb5166725421bb473e6/d121BfwKuez4Xs7tpGnThzfqDXpCgK_large.jpg,0119174

In the midst of epic, violent intrigue in twelfth-century Japan, an imperial warrior falls for a lady-in-waiting; after he discovers she is married, he becomes frenzied in his attempts to win her love.

But when the Nazis force him to impersonate a dead partisan general in prison to extract information from fellow inmates, Bardone finds himself wrestling with his conscience for the first time.

399,GENERAL IDI AMIN DADA: A SELF-PORTRAIT,"In 1974, Barbet Schroeder went to Uganda to make a film about Idi Amin, the country’s ruthless, charismatic dictator. Three years into a murderous regime that would be responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Ugandans, Amin prepared a triumphal greeting for the filmmakers, staging rallies, military maneuvers, and cheery displays of national pride, and envisioning the film as an official portrait to adorn his cult of personality. Schroeder, however, had other ideas, emerging with a disquieting, caustically funny brief against Amin, in which the dictator’s own endless stream of testimony—by turns charming, menacing, and nonsensical—serves as the most damning evidence.

A group of military personnel transporting a hydrogen bomb are left to figure out how and why swarms of killer bugs took down their plane; the answer is more deliriously nihilistic—and convoluted—than you could imagine.

A woman leaves her unfulfilling marriage and embarks on a search for ideal love—but neither a passionate affair with a younger man nor the return of an old romance can provide the answer she seeks.

As her cynicism becomes too much to bear even for her best friend, Rebecca (Scarlett Johansson), Enid finds herself drawn to an unlikely kindred spirit: a sad-sack record collector many years her senior (Steve Buscemi).

In it, Gray, with typical sardonic relish, chronicles his arduous journey through the diagnosis and treatment of a rare and alarming ocular condition.

When adapting Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur’s smash hit playThe Front Page,director Howard Hawks had the inspired idea of turning star reporter Hildy Johnson into a woman, and the result is an immortal mix of hard-boiled newsroom setting with ebullient remarriage comedy.

In such radically playful and visually and sonically arresting works asSurface Tension, Zorns Lemma, (nostalgia), Critical Mass,and the enormous, unfinished Magellan cycle (cut short by his death at age forty-eight), Frampton repurposes cinema itself, making it into something by turns literary, mathematical, sculptural, and simply beautiful—and always captivating.

This spellbinding antiromance was a late-career coup for the legendary Italian filmmaker, and is renowned for its sexual explicitness and an extended scene on a fog-enshrouded highway that stands with the director’s greatest set pieces.",Michelangelo Antonioni,Italy,1982,Italian,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/d7420c2f6615ff1ab92e017c756129a5/szvu000ZTwF1jXwwfQs3WjqS4DOWvy_large.jpg,0084116
487,IF....,"Lindsay Anderson’sIf....is a daringly anarchic vision of British society, set in a boarding school in late-sixties England. Before Kubrick made his mischief iconic inA Clockwork Orange,Malcolm McDowell made a hell of an impression as the insouciant Mick Travis, who, along with his school chums, trumps authority at every turn, finally emerging as a violent savior in the vicious games of one-upmanship played by both students and masters. Mixing color and black and white as audaciously as it mixes fantasy and reality,If….remains one of cinema’s most unforgettable rebel yells.",Lindsay Anderson,United Kingdom,1968,English,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/5c7d3348687e60fb9b7dce2223ae47e5/5aaI9pDV933u89kFpaHXagDJ2HqLEt_large.jpg,0063850
488,I FIDANZATI,"Ermanno Olmi’s masterful feature is the tender story of two Milanese fiancés whose strained relationship is tested when the man accepts a new job in Sicily. With the separation come loneliness, nostalgia, and, perhaps, some new perspectives that might rejuvenate their love.

491,I KNEW HER WELL,"Following the gorgeous, seemingly liberated Adriana (Divorce Italian Style’s Stefania Sandrelli) as she chases her dreams in the Rome ofLa dolce vita, I Knew Her Wellis at once a delightful immersion in the popular music and style of Italy in the sixties and a biting critique of its sexual politics and the culture of celebrity. Over a series of intimate episodes, just about every one featuring a different man, a new hairstyle, and an outfit to match, the unsung Italian master Antonio Pietrangeli, working from a script he cowrote with Ettore Scola, composes a deft, seriocomic character study that never strays from its complicated central figure.I Knew Her Wellis a thrilling rediscovery, by turns funny, tragic, and altogether jaw-dropping.",Antonio Pietrangeli,Italy,1965,Italian,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/62e398f79d4f817613884e489db8046d/IE5uw8MoxPs6597htd7IqOPG2PjoLw_large.jpg,0060545
492,I KNOW WHERE I’M GOING!,"In Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger''s stunningly photographed comedy, romance flourishes in an unlikely place—the bleak and moody Scottish Hebrides.

493,I LIVE IN FEAR,"Both the final film of this period in which Akira Kurosawa would directly wrestle with the demons of the Second World War and his most literal representation of living in an atomic age, the galvanizingI Live in Fearpresents Toshiro Mifune as an elderly, stubborn businessman so fearful of a nuclear attack that he resolves to move his reluctant family to South America.

494,I MARRIED A WITCH,"Veronica Lake casts a seductive spell as a charmingly vengeful sorceress in this supernatural screwball classic. Many centuries after cursing the male descendants of the Salem puritan who sent her to the stake, this blonde bombshell with a broomstick finds herself drawn to one of them—a prospective governor (Fredric March) about to marry a spoiled socialite (Susan Hayward).

Welles stars as a wealthy merchant in nineteenth-century Macao, who becomes obsessed with bringing to life an oft-related anecdote about a rich man who gives a poor sailor a small sum of money to impregnate his wife. Also starring an ethereal Jeanne Moreau, this jewel-like film, dreamily shot by Willy Kurant and suffused with the music of Erik Satie, is a brooding, evocative distillation of Welles’s artistic interests—a story about the nature of storytelling and the fine line between illusion and reality.",Orson Welles,France,1968,"French,                                          English",https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/fa8210c2fd10f3c391f04bb6f851fb24/U450IdSyMxXSVbWgSgCreCuhEeMs56_large.jpg,0063127

497,IN A LONELY PLACE,"When a gifted but washed-up screenwriter with a hair-trigger temper—Humphrey Bogart, in a revelatory, vulnerable performance—becomes the prime suspect in a brutal Tinseltown murder, the only person who can supply an alibi for him is a seductive neighbor (Gloria Grahame) with her own troubled past. The emotionally chargedIn a Lonely Place,freely adapted from a Dorothy B. Hughes thriller, is a brilliant, turbulent mix of suspenseful noir and devastating melodrama, fueled by powerhouse performances. An uncompromising tale of two people desperate to love yet struggling with their demons and each other, this is one of the greatest films of the 1950s, and a benchmark in the career of the classic Hollywood auteur Nicholas Ray.",Nicholas Ray,United States,1950,English,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/df93d59f964f578be1c4ed9db26df611/LHDGeFoUAUtHamDnXwv012TKgg62mL_large.jpg,0042593
498,IN COLD BLOOD,"Truman Capote’s best seller, a breakthrough narrative account of real-life crime and punishment, became an equally chilling film in the hands of writer-director Richard Brooks. Cast for their unsettling resemblances to the killers they play, Robert Blake and Scott Wilson give authentic, unshowy performances as Perry Smith and Dick Hickock, who in 1959 murdered a family of four in Kansas during a botched robbery. Brooks brings a detached, documentary-like starkness to this uncompromising view of an American tragedy and its aftermath; at the same time, stylisticallyIn Cold Bloodis a filmmaking master class, with clinically precise editing, chiaroscuro black-and-white cinematography by the great Conrad Hall, and a menacing jazz score by Quincy Jones.",Richard Brooks,United States,1967,English,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/84453cd1ed9f26281b85c9107c581dab/MrHiNDPFLEUfmHzonSauKOw4DVjDEe_large.jpg,0061809

She flees to Rome’s Stazione Termini, where she bids him farewell, but he begs her to stay. The film’s plot is simple; its production was not. The troubled collaboration between director Vittorio De Sica and producer David O. Selznick resulted in two cuts of the same film. De Sica’s version,Terminal Station, was screened at a length of one-and-a-half hours, but after disappointing previews, Selznick severely re-edited it and changed the title toIndiscretion of an American Wifewithout De Sica’s permission.

500,INGRID BERGMAN: IN HER OWN WORDS,"Whether headlining films in Sweden, Italy, or Hollywood, Ingrid Bergman always pierced the screen with a singular soulfulness. With this new documentary, made on the occasion of the one hundredth anniversary of Bergman’s birth, director Stig Björkman allows us unprecedented access to her world, culling from the most personal of archival materials—letters, diary entries, photographs, and 8 mm and 16 mm footage Bergman herself shot—and following her from youth to tumultuous married life and motherhood.

502,THE INLAND SEA,"In 1971, author and film scholar Donald Richie published a poetic travelogue about his explorations of the islands of Japan’s Inland Sea, recording his search for traces of a traditional way of life as well as his own journey of self-discovery. Twenty years later, filmmaker Lucille Carra undertook a parallel trip inspired by Richie’s by-then-classic book, capturing images of hushed beauty and meeting people who still carried on the fading customs that Richie had observed. Interspersed with surprising detours—visits to a Frank Sinatra–loving monk, a leper colony, an ersatz temple of plywood and plaster—and woven together by Richie’s narration as well as a score by celebrated composer Toru Takemitsu,The Inland Seais an eye-opening voyage and a profound meditation on what it means to be a foreigner.",Lucille Carra,United States,1991,"Japanese,                                          English",https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/9a029e3b8977bb7f3cb8290bfbd4f9a4/vXIQATcZON4HV9vCqpFDM8ZTMrR42c_large.jpg,0104510
571,THE KILLERS,"Ernest Hemingway''s gripping short story The Killers has fascinated readers and filmmakers for generations. In 1964, Don Siegel—initially slated to direct the 1946 version—took it on, creating the first-ever made-for-TV feature, which would prove too violent for American audiences in the wake of JFK''s assassination.",Don Siegel,United States,1964,English,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/fd68e938462eb582cb0de5a34be73d61/AJyDlyL04mfIBYIkBs53hojPoQLt0A_large.jpg,5537002
503,THE IN-LAWS,"Peter Falk and Alan Arkin make for a hilarious dream team in this beloved American sidesplitter. Directed by Arthur Hiller from an ingenious script by Andrew Bergman,The In-Lawsmay at first seem like a generic meet-the-parents comedy, as Arkin’s mild-mannered dentist suspiciously eyes Falk’s volatile mystery man, whose son is engaged to his daughter. But soon, through a series of events too serpentine and surprising to spoil, the two men are brought together by a dangerous mission that takes them from suburban New Jersey to Honduras.

504,INNOCENCE UNPROTECTED,"This utterly unclassifiable film is one of Makavejev’s most freewheeling farces, assembled from the “lost” footage of the first Serbian talkie, a silly melodrama titledInnocence Unprotected,made during the Nazi occupation; contemporary interviews with the megaman who made it and other crew members; and images of the World War II destruction, and subsequent rebuilding, of Belgrade. And at its center is a (real-life) character you won’t soon forget: Dragoljub Aleksic, an acrobat, locksmith, and Houdini-style escape artist whom Makavejev uses as the absurd and wondrous basis for a look back at his country’s tumultuous recent history.",Dušan Makavejev,Yugoslavia,1968,Serbo-Croatian,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/561ccce505c4622a24bd32dfae8565e5/G3vBQac0x5LaFJBmoSIKMWRIRLhO2a_large.jpg,0063342
505,THE INNOCENTS,"This genuinely frightening, exquisitely made supernatural gothic stars Deborah Kerr as an emotionally fragile governess who comes to suspect that there is something very, very wrong with her precocious new charges. A psychosexually intensified adaptation of Henry James’s classicThe Turn of the Screw,cowritten by Truman Capote and directed by Jack Clayton,The Innocentsis a triumph of narrative economy and technical expressiveness, from its chilling sound design to the stygian depths of its widescreen cinematography by Freddie Francis.",Jack Clayton,United States,1961,English,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/4a2579a876453c44391878218c0ff019/BXl2PKj5T4lPvbzJpQb8AQ49rf6uBh_large.jpg,4028464

Yet Shohei Imamura, ever the cinematic “entomologist,” refuses to make a victim of her, instead observing Tomé (played by the extraordinary Sachiko Hidari) as a fascinating, pragmatic creature of twentieth-century Japan.

507,INSIANG,"Jealousy and violence take center stage in this claustrophobic melo­drama, a tautly constructed character study set in the slums of Manila. Lino Brocka crafts an eviscerating portrait of an innocent daughter and her bitter mother as women scorned. Insiang leads a quiet life dominated by household duties, but after she is raped by her mother’s lover and abandoned by the young man who claims to care for her, she exacts vicious revenge. A savage commentary on the degradations of urban poverty, especially for women,Insiangwas the first Philippine film ever to play at Cannes.Insiangwas restored by the Cineteca di Bologna/ L’Immagine Ritrovata.

508,INSIDE LLEWYN DAVIS,"The visionary chroniclers of eccentric Americana Joel and Ethan Coen present one of their greatest creations in Llewyn Davis, a singer barely eking out a living on the peripheries of the flourishing Greenwich Village folk scene of the early sixties. As embodied by Oscar Isaac in a revelatory performance, Llewyn (loosely modeled on the Village folk legend Dave Van Ronk) is extraordinarily talented but also irascible, rude, and self-defeating. His circular odyssey through an unforgiving winter cityscape, evocatively captured by cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel, is realized with poignant humor and the occasional surreal touch. Featuring a folk soundtrack curated by T Bone Burnett,Inside Llewyn Davisreminds us that in the Coens’ world, history isn’t necessarily written by the winners.",Joel Coen and Ethan Coen,United States,2013,English,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/50601e2e6d31f2758588c3375c856abe/Mij0GgpVEQDG55eQGe1juUCJWRmy9f_large.jpg,2042568
509,INSIGNIFICANCE,"Four unnamed people who look and sound a lot like Albert Einstein, Marilyn Monroe, Joe DiMaggio, and Joseph McCarthy converge in one New York City hotel room in this compelling, visually inventive adaptation of Terry Johnson’s play, from director Nicolas Roeg. With a combination of whimsy and dread, Roeg creates a fun-house-mirror image of fifties America in order to reflect on the nature of celebrity and lingering cold-war nuclear nightmares.Insignificanceis a delirious, intelligent drama, featuring magnetic performances by Michael Emil as the Professor, Theresa Russell as the Actress, Gary Busey as the Ballplayer, and Tony Curtis as the Senator.",Nicolas Roeg,United Kingdom,1985,English,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/a5e3fd6f03567fe6a67f8b3b9eaa867d/mjZx83OMMuc168S7NOnc4FdO4ZI1rL_large.jpg,0089343

As he digs deeper into the facts surrounding the heinous killing, his own demons and the tyrannical midnight sun begin to take a toll.

But rather than become a victim, she forges a path to her own awakening.

512,INTERMEZZO,"This gorgeous romantic confection, which catalogs a doomed love affair between a married violin virtuoso and a young pianist, is graced by a leading performance by Ingrid Bergman (her first), in a role created especially for her; a costarring turn by the legendary Swedish actor Gösta Ekman; and beautiful direction by Gustaf Molander. It was a defining part for Bergman, as it made her a star in Sweden and caught the eye of American producer David O.

Director Norman Jewison splices incisive social commentary into this thrilling police procedural with the help of Haskell Wexler’s vivid cinematography, Quincy Jones’s eclectic score, and two indelible lead performances—a career-defining display of seething indignation and moral authority from Poitier and an Oscar-winning master class in Method acting from Steiger.

Their encounters are formal and polite—until a discovery about their spouses creates an intimate bond between them. At once delicately mannered and visually extravagant, Wong Kar-wai’sIn the Mood for Loveis a masterful evocation of romantic longing and fleeting moments.

515,IN THE REALM OF THE SENSES,"In the Realm of the Senses(Ai no corrida), by the always provocative Japanese director Nagisa Oshima, remains one of the most controversial films of all time. Based on a true incident, it graphically depicts the all-consuming, transcendent—but ultimately destructive—love of a man and a woman (Tatsuya Fuji and Eiko Matsuda) living in an era of ever escalating imperialism and governmental control.

With the intimate feel of a documentary and the texture of a Vermeer painting,In Vanda’s Roomtakes an unflinching, fragmentary look at a handful of self-destructive, marginalized people, but is centered around the heroin-addicted Vanda Duarte. Costa presents the daily routines of Vanda and her neighbors with disarming matter-of-factness, and through his camera, individuals whom many would deem disposable become vivid and vital.

Petri maintains a tricky balance between absurdity and realism in telling the Kafkaesque tale of a Roman police inspector (a commanding Gian Maria Volonté) investigating a heinous crime—which he himself committed. Both a compelling character study and a disturbing commentary on the draconian government crackdowns in Italy in the late 1960s and early ’70s, Petri’s kinetic portrait of surreal bureaucracy is a perversely pleasurable rendering of controlled chaos.",Elio Petri,Italy,1970,Italian,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/5bd2440e3403f8dcde2be7ddf15259b4/y0ZcQrhquZWlqSkkKkxzNUX9buPZkl_large.jpg,0065889

Coward and Lean ended up codirecting the large-scale project—an impressive undertaking, especially considering that neither of them had directed for the big screen before (this would be Coward’s only such credit).

Josef von Sternberg’sThe Last Commandis a brilliantly realized silent melodrama and a witty send-up of the Hollywood machine, featuring virtuoso cinematography, grandly designed sets and effects, and rousing Russian Revolution sequences. Towering above it all is the passionate, heartbreaking Jannings, whose portrayal of a man losing his grip on reality is one for the history books.",Josef von Sternberg,United States,1928,Silent,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/2b931ae29e86d4ed2063537bf098980c/OKZUvVNJVZ8ObmVB14S6T0rxmoG8CA_large.jpg,0019071
558,KAMERADSCHAFT,"When a coal mine collapses on the frontier between Germany and France and traps a team of French miners, workers on both sides of the border spring into action, putting aside national prejudices and wartime grudges to launch a dangerous rescue operation. Director G. W. Pabst brings a vivid sense of claustrophobia to this ticking-clock scenario, using realistic sets and sound design to create the maze of soot-choked shafts where the miners struggle for survival. Inspired by a real-life mine collapse,Kameradschaft(Comradeship) is an arresting disaster film and a stirring plea for international cooperation, and it cemented Pabst’s status as one of the most morally engaged and formally dexterous filmmakers of his time.",G.

562,THE KENNEDY FILMS OF ROBERT DREW & ASSOCIATES,"Seeking to invigorate the American documentary format, which he felt was rote and uninspired, Robert Drew brought the style and vibrancy he had fostered as aLifemagazine correspondent to filmmaking in the late fifties. He did this by assembling an amazing team—including such eventual nonfiction luminaries as Richard Leacock, D. A. Pennebaker, and Albert Maysles—that would transform documentary cinema. In 1960, the group was granted direct access to John F. Kennedy, filming him on the campaign trail and eventually in the Oval Office. This resulted in three films of remarkable, behind-closed-doors intimacy—Primary, Adventures on the New Frontier,andCrisis—and, following the president’s assassination, the poetic shortFaces of November.Collected here are all four of these titles, early exemplars of the movement known as Direct Cinema and featuring the greatest close-up footage we have of this American icon.",Robert Drew,United States,0,English,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/cd4e04ca68b6bfb60fdcbb7ea6b8386f/JtYzw2kwoN2ahEB7YqQiYXBBzRbTvp_large.jpg,6426680

Academy Award–nominated screenwriter Noah Baumbach’s hilarious and touching directorial debut was one of the highlights of the American independent film scene of the nineties, speaking directly to a generation of adults-to-be unable to reconcile their hermetic educational experience with workaday responsibility, and posing the eternal question, where do we go from here?

In it, he stars as his lovable Tramp character, this time raising an orphan (a remarkable young Jackie Coogan) he has rescued from the streets.

595,THE LAST DAYS OF DISCO,"The Last Days of Disco, from director Whit Stillman, is a cleverly comic look at the early 1980s Manhattan party scene from the vantage point of the late nineties. At the center of the film’s roundelay of revelers are the icy Charlotte (Kate Beckinsale) and the demure Alice (Chloë Sevigny), by day toiling as publishing house assistants and by night looking for romance and entertainment at a Studio 54–like club.

When a traveling medicine show rolls into town, it brings with it excitement, the possibility of love, and a chance for Harold to prove his mettle. Deftly balancing Lloyd’s brilliant sight gags and thrilling set pieces—including an epic, knock-down, drag-out fight aboard an abandoned ship—with one of the actor-filmmaker’s most fully realized, root-for-the-underdog narratives,The Kid Brotheris a hilarious and heartwarming high-water mark of early screen comedy.",Ted Wilde,United States,1927,English,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/4b81c33aa97a34e6468805d64920da24/M921R58LZngKVnsquGrfhJqCBnRw40_large.jpg,0018051

But when both men discover the wrongdoings of the nefarious clan leader, they side with a band of rebels who are under siege at a remote mountain cabin.

572,THE KILLING,"Stanley Kubrick’s account of an ambitious racetrack robbery is one of Hollywood’s tautest, twistiest noirs. Aided by a radically time-shuffling narrative, razor-sharp dialogue from pulp novelist Jim Thompson, and a phenomenal cast of character actors, including Sterling Hayden, Coleen Gray, Timothy Carey, Elisha Cook Jr., and Marie Windsor,The Killingis both a jaunty thriller and a cold-blooded punch to the gut.

When he runs afoul of loan sharks, Cosmo must carry out a terrible crime or lose his way of life. Mesmerizing and idiosyncratic, the film is a provocative examination of masculine identity.

576,KING OF JAZZ,"Made during the early years of the movie musical, this exuberant revue was one of the most extravagant, eclectic, and technically ambitious Hollywood productions of its day. Starring the bandleader Paul Whiteman, then widely celebrated as the King of Jazz, the film drew from Broadway variety shows to present a spectacular array of sketches, performances by such acts as the Rhythm Boys (featuring a young Bing Crosby), and orchestral numbers—all lavishly staged by veteran theater director John Murray Anderson.

593,LAND OF MILK AND HONEY,"Pierre Etaix’s most radical film, and perhaps unsurprisingly the one that effectively ended his career in cinema,Land of Milk and Honeyis a fascinating investigative documentary about post–May ’68 French society. In it, Etaix trains his discerning eye on idle summer vacationers, but the film has bigger fish to fry, asking pertinent questions about the sexualization of culture, class and gender inequality, media and advertising, and even architecture.",Pierre Etaix,France,1971,French,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/9338968c02e3cf86bb7977a63afc8951/oAYYTpQWoVaKq9QrP3CYJjKbNmzieE_large.jpg,0258013

596,THE LAST EMPEROR,"Bernardo Bertolucci''sThe Last Emperorwon nine Academy Awards, unexpectedly sweeping every category in which it was nominated—quite a feat for a challenging, multilayered epic directed by an Italian and starring an international cast. Yet the power and scope of the film was, and remains, undeniable—the life of Emperor Pu Yi, who took the throne at age three, in 1908, before witnessing decades of cultural and political upheaval, within and without the walls of the Forbidden City.

598,THE LAST METRO,"Gérard Depardieu and Catherine Deneuve star as members of a French theater company living under the German occupation during World War II in François Truffaut’s gripping, humanist character study. Against all odds—a Jewish theater manager in hiding; a leading man who’s in the Resistance; increasingly restrictive Nazi oversight—the troupe believes the show must go on.

600,THE LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST,"The Last Temptation of Christ,by Martin Scorsese, is a towering achievement. Though it initially engendered enormous controversy, the film can now be viewed as the remarkable, profoundly personal work of faith that it is. This fifteen-year labor of love, an adaptation of Nikos Kazantzakis’s landmark novel that imagines an alternate fate for Jesus Christ, features outstanding performances by Willem Dafoe, Barbara Hershey, Harvey Keitel, Harry Dean Stanton, and David Bowie; bold cinematography by the great Michael Ballhaus; and a transcendent score by Peter Gabriel.",Martin Scorsese,United States,1988,English,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/e72cb0861039ef5bfdd83eacc957ac58/1AczZQpaiRXO7xuSX9ZuGi8dpti30Z_large.jpg,3581920

602,LAST YEAR AT MARIENBAD,"Not just a defining work of the French New Wave but one of the great, lasting mysteries of modern art, Alain Resnais’ epochalLast Year at Marienbad(L’année dernière à Marienbad) has been puzzling appreciative viewers for decades. Written by radical master of the New Novel Alain Robbe-Grillet, this surreal fever dream, or nightmare, gorgeously fuses the past with the present in telling its ambiguous tale of a man and a woman (Giorgio Albertazzi and Delphine Seyrig) who may or may not have met a year ago, perhaps at the very same cathedral-like, mirror-filled château they now find themselves wandering. Unforgettable in both its confounding details (gilded ceilings, diabolical parlor games, a loaded gun) and haunting scope, Resnais’ investigation into the nature of memory is disturbing, romantic, and maybe even a ghost story.",Alain Resnais,France,1961,French,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/d2c4d40b1ce44f03b1c60a2ae9829ded/EGvQdEyNez1O8QmzlhTj1a1gyGcKHg_large.jpg,0054632
603,L’ATALANTE,"In Jean Vigo’s hands, an unassuming tale of conjugal love becomes an achingly romantic reverie of desire and hope.

We watch as ten-year-old François (Michel Terrazon) is shuttled from one home to another, his behavior growing increasingly erratic, his bonds with his surrogate parents perennially fraught. In this, his feature debut, Pialat treats that potentially sentimental scenario with astonishing sobriety and stark realism.

The film recreates, with nostalgia, drama, and opulence, the tumultuous years of Italy''sRisorgimento—when the aristocracy lost its grip and the middle classes rose and formed a unified, democratic Italy.

Despite his lack of political convictions, photojournalist Bruno Forestier (Michel Subor) is roped into a paramilitary group waging a shadow war in Geneva against the Algerian independence movement. Anna Karina (in her first collaboration with Godard, whose camera is visibly besotted with her) is beguiling as the mysterious woman with whom Forestier becomes infatuated.

Isabelle reveals deep wells of yearning, vulnerability, and resilience as she tumbles into relationships with all the wrong men.

Roger Livesey dynamically embodies outmoded English militarism as the indelible General Clive Candy, who barely survives four decades of tumultuous British history, 1902 to 1942, only to see the world change irrevocably before his eyes. Anton Walbrook and Deborah Kerr provide unforgettable support, he as a German enemy turned lifelong friend of Candy’s and she as young women of three consecutive generations—a socially committed governess, a sweet-souled war nurse, and a modern-thinking army driver—who inspire him.Colonel Blimpis both moving and slyly satirical, an incomparable film about war, love, aging, and obsolescence, shot in gorgeous Technicolor.",Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger,United Kingdom,1943,English,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/18965c86f7667517e1f49865a63ef3e3/J8DLPfC9l8hKQqoR0JBCEkfis6ztSz_large.jpg,0036112

625,LIMELIGHT,"Charlie Chaplin’s masterful drama about the twilight of a former vaudeville star is among the writer-director’s most touching films. Chaplin plays Calvero, a once beloved musical-comedy performer, now a washed-up alcoholic who lives in a small London flat. A glimmer of hope arrives when he meets a beautiful but melancholy ballerina (Claire Bloom) who lives downstairs. An elegant mix of the comic and the tragic, this poignant movie also features Buster Keaton in an extended cameo, marking the only time the two silent comedy icons appeared in a film together.

Inspired by a haunting André Kertész photograph on the cover of a French magazine, this avant-garde silent master­piece centers on a man and two women lost at sea, their pasts unfolding through flashbacks propelled by the music of Erik Satie, Claude Debussy, Igor Stravinsky, and others. An early work of independent Latin American filmmaking,Limitewas famously difficult to see for most of the twentieth century.

628,THE LIVING MAGOROKU,"A superstitious farming family is hesitant to use its fields to grow crops to help feed the nation’s troops.

Riffing on popular representations of Scottish life and folklore,Local Herofollows the Texas oil executive Mac (Peter Riegert), who is dispatched by his crackpot boss (Burt Lancaster) to a remote seaside village in Scotland with orders to buy out the town and develop the region for an oil refinery. But as business mixes with pleasure, Mac finds himself enchanted by both the picturesque community and its oddball denizens—and Texas starts to feel awfully far away. Packed with a near nonstop stream of droll one-liners and deadpan gags, this enchanting cult hit finds Forsyth surveying the idiosyncrasies of small-town life with the satirical verve of a latter-day Preston Sturges, arriving at a sly commentary on conservation, corporate greed, and the legacies we leave behind.",Bill Forsyth,United Kingdom,1983,English,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/404d9791922b336d3015f1500ee014eb/tG4CJ9c3PbmNziiX4KClVc9Pj6MsDU_large.jpg,0085859

This haunting silent thriller tells the tale of a mysterious young man (matinee idol Ivor Novello) who takes up residence at a London boardinghouse just as a killer known as the Avenger descends upon the city, preying on blonde women.

It’s among his most profoundly felt films, a tale of crisscrossing lives in Nantes (Demy’s hometown) that floats on waves of longing and desire. Heading the film’s ensemble is the enchanting Anouk Aimée as the title character, a cabaret chanteuse who’s awaiting the return of a long-lost lover and unwilling to entertain the adoration of another love-struck soul, the wanderer Roland (Marc Michel).

While under contract at Universal, Fejos pulled out all the stops for this lovely, largely silent New York City symphony set in antic Coney Island during the Fourth of July weekend, employing color tinting, superimposition effects, experimental editing, and a roving camera (plus three dialogue scenes, added to satisfy the new craze for talkies). For years,Lonesomehas been a rare treat for festival and cinematheque audiences, but it’s only now coming to home video.

642,THE LONG DAY CLOSES,"The Long Day Closesis the most gloriously cinematic expression of the unique sensibility of Terence Davies, widely celebrated as Britain’s greatest living filmmaker. Suffused with both enchantment and melancholy, this autobiographical film takes on the perspective of a quiet, lonely boy growing up in Liverpool in the 1950s. But rather than employ a straightforward narrative, Davies jumps in and out of time, swoops into fantasies and fears, summons memories and dreams.

644,LORD OF THE FLIES,"In the hands of the renowned experimental theater director Peter Brook, William Golding’s legendary novel about the primitivism lurking beneath civilization becomes a film as raw and ragged as the lost boys at its center. Taking an innovative documentary-like approach, Brook shotLord of the Flieswith an off-the-cuff naturalism, seeming to record a spontaneous eruption of its characters’ ids. The result is a rattling masterpiece, as provocative as its source material.",Peter Brook,United Kingdom,1963,English,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/3c8e34ba4a541897737232a90611f947/uMJyxowOApuQ9O1hh2wLe26pqL14z1_large.jpg,0100054

Suddenly a suspect, Katharina is subject to a vicious smear campaign by the police and a ruthless tabloid journalist, testing the limits of her dignity and her sanity.

As beguiling a raconteur as he is a performer, Louie makes for a wildly entertaining movie subject, and Zwigoff honors him with an unsentimental but endlessly affectionate tribute.

Yet in Dusan Makavejev’s manic hands, this second feature becomes an endlessly surprising, time-shifting exploration of love and freedom. Featuring interludes of interviews with a sexologist and a criminologist, as well as some of the most elegant dramatic filmmaking of the director’s career,Love Affair,based on a true incident, further demonstrated Makavejev’s adeptness at mixing and matching genres, and his odd, sophisticated humanism.",Dušan Makavejev,Yugoslavia,1967,Serbo-Croatian,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/5eb3b02cc20d9090e506fdd942b92cab/WsP71MgPQ5GmNEtT7QghC3MI3epzGp_large.jpg,0061912

His flirtations and fantasies remain harmless until Chloé (played by the mesmerizing Zouzou), an audacious, unencumbered old flame, shows up at his office, embodying the first genuine threat to Frédéric’s marriage.

653,THE LOVERS,"Louis Malle unveiled the natural beauty of Jeanne Moreau in his breakthrough,Elevator to the Gallows. With his follow-up, the scandalous smashThe Lovers(Les amants), he made her a star once and for all. A deeply felt and luxuriously filmed fairy tale for grown-ups, perched on the edge between classical and New Wave cinemas,The Loverspresents Moreau as a restless bourgeois wife whose eye wanders from both her husband and her lover to an attractive passing stranger (Jean-Marc Bory).

656,THE LOWER DEPTHS,"Jean Renoir and Akira Kurosawa, two of cinema''s greatest directors, transform Maxim Gorky''s classic proletariat playThe Lower Depthsin their own ways for their own times. Renoir, working amidst the rise of Hitler and the Popular Front in France, had need to take license with the dark nature of Gorky''s source material, softening its bleak outlook. Kurosawa, firmly situated in the postwar world, found little reason for hope. He remained faithful to the original with its focus on the conflict between illusion and reality—a theme he would return to over and over again.

Scripted by Jacques Prévert and Pierre Laroche, the film was banned from theaters for the duration of the occupation for its dark portrayal of the hedonistic excesses of the ruling class.

658,THE LURE,"This genre-defying horror-musical mash-up—the bold debut of Polish director Agnieszka Smoczyńska—follows a pair of carnivorous mermaid sisters drawn ashore to explore life on land in an alternate 1980s Poland. Their tantalizing siren songs and otherworldly auras make them overnight sensations as nightclub singers in the half-glam, half-decrepit world of Smoczyńska’s imagining. The director gives fierce teeth to her viscerally sensual, darkly feminist twist on Hans Christian Andersen’s “The Little Mermaid,” in which the girls’ bond is tested and their survival threatened after one sister falls for a human.

660,MACBETH,"Roman Polanski imbues his unflinchingly violent adaptation of William Shakespeare’s tragedy of ruthless ambition and murder in medieval Scotland with grit and dramatic intensity. Jon Finch and Francesca Annis give performances charged with fury and sex appeal as a decorated warrior rising through the ranks and his driven wife, scheming together to take the throne by any means.

662,MADE IN U.S.A,"With its giddily complex noir plot and color-drenched widescreen images,Made in U.S.Awas a final burst of exuberance from Jean-Luc Godard’s early sixties barrage of delirious movie-movies. Yet this chaotic crime thriller and acidly funny critique of consumerism—starring Anna Karina as the most brightly dressed private investigator in film history, searching for a former lover who might have been assassinated—also points toward the more political cinema that would come to define Godard. Featuring characters with names such as Richard Nixon, Robert McNamara, David Goodis, and Doris Mizoguchi, and appearances by a slapstick Jean-Pierre Léaud and a sweetly singing Marianne Faithfull, this piece of pop art is like a Looney Tunes rendition ofThe Big Sleepgone New Wave.",Jean-Luc Godard,France,1966,French,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/efd916dcd675095973e44745477f9b21/xUcTSIdAupkO5KPIrrvCkfJpbLO4jP_large.jpg,0060647
663,MADONNA OF THE SEVEN MOONS,"A lurid tale of sex and psychosis,Madonna of the Seven Moons,directed by Arthur Crabtree, is among the wildest of the Gainsborough melodramas. Set in Italy, it begins as a comparatively sedate tale about a respectable, convent-raised woman (Phyllis Calvert) who is haunted by the memory of being raped as a teenager. But when her grown daughter returns from school, her life begins to unravel in monumentally surprising ways.",Arthur Crabtree,United Kingdom,1945,English,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/bd2452146ea73af63f76a550204841f9/4yJd8DqIYDNQ5jaoJpFxnPPkbFjdAG_large.jpg,0037035

But Antonio gets more than he bargained for when he discovers some harsh truths about his ancestors—and himself.

665,THE MAGIC FLUTE,"This scintillating screen version of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart’s beloved opera showcases Ingmar Bergman’s deep knowledge of music and gift for expressing it cinematically. Casting some of Europe’s finest soloists—Josef Köstlinger, Ulrik Cold, Håkan Hagegård, and Birgit Nordin among them—the director lovingly recreated the baroque theater of Sweden’s Drottningholm Palace to stage the story of the prince Tamino and his zestful sidekick Papageno, who are sent on a mission to save a beautiful princess from the clutches of evil.

666,THE MAGICIAN,"WithThe Magician,an engaging, brilliantly conceived tale of chicanery that doubles as a symbolic portrait of the artist as a deceiver, Ingmar Bergman proved himself to be one of cinema’s premier illusionists. Max von Sydow stars as Dr. Vogler, a nineteenth-century traveling mesmerist and peddler of potions whose magic is put to the test in Stockholm by the cruel, eminently rational royal medical adviser Dr. Vergérus (Gunnar Björnstrand). The result is a diabolically clever battle of wits that’s both frightening and funny, shot by Gunnar Fischer in rich, gorgeously gothic black and white.",Ingmar Bergman,Sweden,1958,Swedish,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/727f4c05f133f7593907dea12c0263c8/pwXirphyQTlMatY7iBtZ9Mb0svCuzs_large.jpg,4254242

Adapted from an acclaimed Booth Tarkington novel and featuring restlessly inventive camera work and powerful performances from a cast including Joseph Cotten, Tim Holt, and Agnes Moorehead, the film traces the rifts deepening within the Amberson clan—at the same time as the forces of progress begin to transform the city they once ruled. Though RKO excised over forty minutes of footage, now lost to history, and added an incongruously upbeat ending,The Magnificent Ambersonsis an emotionally rich family saga and a masterful elegy for a bygone chapter of American life.",Orson Welles,United States,1942,English,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/508da13d74af7209190380bec79002ab/KzkULFHCmg1KGSgM6OAm6LQUONSDWJ_large.jpg,0035015

Thus begins one of Douglas Sirk’s most flamboyant master classes in melodrama, a delirious Technicolor mix of the sudsy and the spiritual in which Bob and the doctor’s widow, Helen (Jane Wyman), find themselves inextricably linked amid a series of increasingly wild twists, turns, trials, and tribulations.",Douglas Sirk,United States,1954,English,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/e033d65a68d10236f332c06ce3725b59/5Pvpc7nsRpgo8lu3IQVlAeheME1g9w_large.jpg,0047203

Kingsley debating and attacking his hangers-on and enemies.

672,MAKE WAY FOR TOMORROW,"Make Way for Tomorrow,by Leo McCarey, is one of the great unsung Hollywood masterpieces, an enormously moving Depression-era depiction of the frustrations of family, aging, and the generation gap. Beulah Bondi and Victor Moore headline a cast of incomparable character actors, starring as an elderly couple who must move in with their grown children after the bank takes their home, yet end up separated and subject to their offspring’s selfish whims.

The two oldest have been married for some time, but according to tradition, the rebellious youngest sister cannot wed until the third, conservative and terribly shy, finds a husband.

675,MALA NOCHE,"With its low budget and lush black-and-white imagery, Gus Van Sant''s debut featureMala Nocheheralded an idiosyncratic, provocative new voice in American independent film. Set in Van Sant''s hometown of Portland, Oregon, the film evokes a world of transient workers, dead-end day-shifters, and bars and seedy apartments bathed in a profound nighttime, as it follows a romantic deadbeat with a wayward crush on a handsome Mexican immigrant.Mala Nochewas an important prelude to the New Queer Cinema of the nineties and is a fascinating capsule from a time and place that continues to haunt its director''s work.",Gus Van Sant,United States,1985,English,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/f02f7508220639e063310b7ce6cdeb17/SJB8Gpe59wXrp6mPEg2abzw31HI6jk_large.jpg,0089537

Set in the early fifties, this razor-sharp adaptation of the novel by Richard Condon concerns the decorated U.S. Army sergeant Raymond Shaw (Laurence Harvey), who as a prisoner during the Korean War is brainwashed into becoming a sleeper assassin in a Communist conspiracy, and a fellow POW (Frank Sinatra) who slowly uncovers the sinister plot. In an unforgettable performance, Angela Lansbury plays Raymond’s villainous mother, the controlling wife of a witch-hunting anti-Communist senator with his eyes on the White House.

In the meantime, he takes a low-wage job at a construction site and witnesses life on the streets, where death strikes without warning, corruption and exploitation are commonplace, and protests hint at escalating civil unrest.

The story of an alien on an elaborate rescue mission provides the launching pad for Nicolas Roeg’s visual tour de force, a formally adventurous examination of alienation in contemporary life. Rock legend David Bowie, in his acting debut, completely embodies the title role, while Candy Clark, Buck Henry, and Rip Torn turn in pitch-perfect supporting performances.

Vláčil’s approach was to re-create the textures and mentalities of a long-ago way of life, rather than to make a conventional historical drama, and the result is dazzling.

These are signature Graham works and tributes to the art of the human body.",Nathan Kroll,United States,1959,English,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/85fde6e10c9b088d8feed4809ede6995/ZXZHb9g0k9jNqHuCOOFh00ggApkwZq_large.jpg,13129952
691,MASCULIN FÉMININ,"WithMasculin féminin,ruthless stylist and iconoclast Jean-Luc Godard introduces the world to the children of Marx and Coca-Cola, through a gang of restless youths engaged in hopeless love affairs with music, revolution, and each other. French new wave icon Jean-Pierre Leaud stars as Paul, an idealistic would-be intellectual struggling to forge a relationship with the adorable pop star Madeleine (real-life yé-yé girl Chantal Goya). Through their tempestuous affair, Godard fashions a candid and wildly funny free-form examination of youth culture in throbbing 1960s Paris, mixing satire and tragedy as only Godard can.",Jean-Luc Godard,France,1966,French,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/64d21e77f437a54ee85b075a18810951/iE2Kc5MVA6KSohkGrrFvNEFGcuH3op_large.jpg,0060675
692,THE MASSEURS AND A WOMAN,"A pair of blind masseurs, an enigmatic city woman, a lonely man and his ill-behaved nephew—The Masseurs and a Womanis made up of crisscrossing miniature studies of love and family at a remote resort in the mountains.

693,A MASTER BUILDER,"Twenty years after their brilliant cinema-theater experimentVanya on 42nd Street,Wallace Shawn and André Gregory reunited to produce another idiosyncratic film version of a classic play, this time Henrik Ibsen’sBygmester Solness(Master Builder Solness). Brought pristinely to the screen by Jonathan Demme, this compellingly abstract reimagining features Shawn (who also wrote the adaptation) as a visionary but tyrannical middle-aged architect haunted by figures from his past, most acutely an attractive, vivacious young woman (the breathtaking newcomer Lisa Joyce) who has appeared on his doorstep. Also featuring standout supporting performances by Julie Hagerty, Larry Pine, and Gregory,A Master Builder,likeVanya,is the result of many years of rehearsals, a living, breathing, constantly shifting work that unites theater, film, and dream.",Jonathan Demme,United States,2014,English,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/4d12d0b6523c10060860b2695f32672f/KmC0p8LFp4dAfgyLalLkQRoZgakcY3_large.jpg,2276069
694,MASTER OF THE HOUSE,"Before he turned to the story of Joan of Arc, the Danish cinema genius Carl Theodor Dreyer fashioned this ahead-of-its-time examination of domestic life. A deft comedy of gentle revenge, it is the story of a housewife who, with the help of a wily nanny, turns the tables on her tyrannical husband. In it, Dreyer combines lightness and humor with his customary meticulous craft and sense of integrity.Master of the House,an enormous box-office success in its day, is a jewel of the silent cinema.",Carl Th.

695,THE MATCH FACTORY GIRL,"Kaurismäki took his penchant for despairing character studies to unspeakably grim depths in the shockingly entertainingThe Match Factory Girl.Kati Outinen is memorably impenetrable as Iris, whose grinding days as a cog in a factory wheel, and nights as a neglected daughter living with her parents, ultimately send her over the edge. Yet despite her transgressions, Kaurismäki makes Iris a compelling, even sympathetic figure. Bleak yet suffused with comic irony,The Match Factory Girlcloses out the “Proletariat Trilogy” with a bang—and a whimper.",Aki Kaurismäki,Finland,1990,Finnish,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/fdfbd230ca10df2fde7939762a75725c/hpudPXhRIeQlGJOhIPkDieYc1hfELO_large.jpg,0098532

When Matewan’s miners go on strike, organizer Joe Kenehan (Chris Cooper, in his film debut) arrives to help them, uniting workers white and black, Appalachia-born and immigrant, while urging patience in the face of the coal company’s violent provocations. With a crackerjack ensemble cast—including James Earl Jones, David Strathairn, Mary McDonnell, and Will Oldham—and Oscar-nominated cinematography by Haskell Wexler,Matewantaps into a rich vein of Americana with painstaking attention to local texture, issuing an impassioned cry for justice that still resounds today.",John Sayles,United States,1987,English,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/cbcfd13607da02c008bac763443a428e/A5FgzMYh7cEOvsCZ4XHBqvwnOlaUWL_large.jpg,0093509

When a messenger from the hereafter arrives to correct the bureaucratic error that spared his life, Peter must mount a fierce defense for his right to stay on earth—painted by production designer Alfred Junge and cinematographer Jack Cardiff as a rich Technicolor Eden—climbing a wide staircase to stand trial in a starkly beautiful, black-and-white modernist afterlife.

699,MCCABE & MRS. MILLER,"This unorthodox dream western by Robert Altman may be the most radically beautiful film to come out of the New American Cinema. It stars Warren Beatty and Julie Christie as two newcomers to the raw Pacific Northwest mining town of Presbyterian Church, who join forces to provide the miners with a superior kind of whorehouse experience. The appearance of representatives of a powerful mining company with interests of its own, however, threatens to be the undoing of their plans. With its fascinating flawed characters, evocative cinematography by the great Vilmos Zsigmond, innovative overlapping dialogue, and haunting use of Leonard Cohen songs,McCabe & Mrs. Millerbrilliantly deglamorized and revitalized the most American of genres.",Robert Altman,United States,1971,English,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/9676ccbf8da26b964e0339ec979c1815/krYPZfP7VVBB2wRzYqXJaw2tJtzPR4_large.jpg,0067411
700,MEANTIME,"A slow-burning depiction of economic degradation in Thatcher’s England, Mike Leigh’sMeantimeis the culmination of the writer-director’s pioneering work in television. Unemployment is rampant in London’s working-class East End, where a middle-aged couple and their two sons languish in a claustrophobic public-housing flat. As the brothers (Phil Daniels and Tim Roth) grow increasingly disaffected, Leigh punctuates the grinding boredom of their daily existence with tense encounters, including with a priggish aunt (Marion Bailey) who has managed to become middle-class and a blithering skinhead on the verge of psychosis (a scene-stealing Gary Oldman, in his first major role). Informed by Leigh’s now trademark improvisational process and propelled by the lurching rhythms of its Beckett-like dialogue,Meantimeis an unrelenting, often blisteringly funny look at life on the dole.",Mike Leigh,United Kingdom,1984,English,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/6c6bfbed7167e5951b922334bd8b4711/0c2Z1MYRYKs2VIlEZHrgHxQtyoHgXj_large.jpg,0082727

With the U.S. in social upheaval, famed cinematographer Haskell Wexler decided to make a film about what the hell was going on.Medium Cool, his debut feature, plunges us into the moment. With its mix of fictional storytelling and documentary technique, this depiction of the working world and romantic life of a television cameraman (Robert Forster) is a visceral cinematic snapshot of the era, climaxing with an extended sequence shot right in the middle of the riots surrounding the Democratic National Convention in Chicago.

702,MEMORIES OF UNDERDEVELOPMENT,"This film by Tomás Gutiérrez Alea is the most renowned work in the history of Cuban cinema. After his wife and family flee in the wake of the Bay of Pigs invasion, the bourgeois intellectual Sergio (Sergio Corrieri) passes his days wandering Havana in idle reflection, his amorous entanglements and political ambivalence gradually giving way to a mounting sense of alienation. With this adaptation of an innovative novel by Edmundo Desnoes, Gutiérrez Alea developed a cinematic style as radical as the times he was chronicling, creating a collage of vivid impressions through the use of experimental editing techniques, archival material, and spontaneously shot street scenes. Intimate and densely layered,Memories of Underdevelopmentprovides an indictment of its protagonist’s disengagement and an extraordinary glimpse of life in postrevolutionary Cuba.Memories of Underdevelopmentwas restored by the Cineteca di Bologna at L’Immagine Ritrovata laboratory in association with Instituto Cubano del Arte e Industria Cinematográficos (ICAIC).

Fassbinder had gained acclaim for a series of trenchant, quickly made early films, but for this one he took more time and forged a new style—featuring a more complexly woven script and narrative structure and more sophisticated use of the camera, and influenced by the work of his recently discovered idol, Douglas Sirk. The result is a meticulously made, unforgiving social satire.",Rainer Werner Fassbinder,Germany,1971,German,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/4345be062217f5128a742868d437e3b0/1a6ixmqVTV7IW4Sor60w8cVcYMxbgx_large.jpg,0067227
706,MERRY CHRISTMAS MR. LAWRENCE,"In this captivating, skewed World War II drama from Nagisa Oshima, David Bowie regally embodies Celliers, a British officer interned by the Japanese as a POW. Rock star Ryuichi Sakamoto (who also composed this film’s hypnotic score) plays the camp commander, obsessed with the mysterious blond major, while Tom Conti is the British lieutenant colonel Lawrence, who tries to bridge the emotional and language divides between captor and prisoner.

707,METROPOLITAN,"One of the great American independent films of the 1990s, the surprise hitMetropolitan,by writer-director Whit Stillman, is a sparkling comedic chronicle of a young man’s romantic misadventures while trying to fit in to New York City’s debutante society. Stillman’s deft, literate dialogue and hilariously highbrow observations earned this first film an Academy Award nomination for best original screenplay.

764,NAKED LUNCH,"In this adaptation of William S. Burroughs’s hallucinatory, once-thought-unfilmable novelNaked Lunch,directed by David Cronenberg, a part-time exterminator and full-time drug addict named Bill Lee (Peter Weller) plunges into the nightmarish Interzone, a netherworld of sinister cabals and giant talking bugs. Alternately humorous and grotesque—and always surreal—the film mingles aspects of Burroughs’s novel with incidents from the writer’s own life, resulting in an evocative paranoid fantasy and a self-reflexive investigation into the mysteries of the creative process.",David Cronenberg,Canada,1991,English,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/90d418713a2e7ecc053c7cea7f3edc07/BmQGbMPdDYJ7IwGNosdZiWUsJXh3EI_large.jpg,0102511

711,MILDRED PIERCE,"Melodrama casts noirish shadows in this portrait of maternal sacrifice from Hollywood master Michael Curtiz. Its iconic performance by Joan Crawford as Mildred, a single mother hell-bent on freeing her children from the stigma of economic hardship, solidified Crawford’s career comeback and gave the actor her only Oscar. But as Mildred pulls herself up by the bootstraps, first as an unflappable waitress and eventually as the well-heeled owner of a successful restaurant chain, the ingratitude of her materialistic firstborn (a diabolical Ann Blyth) becomes a venomous serpent’s tooth, setting in motion an endless cycle of desperate overtures and heartless recriminations.

Two French beggars, present-day pilgrims en route to Spain''s holy city of Santiago de Compostela, serve as Buñuel''s narrators for an anticlerical history of heresy, told with absurdity and filled with images that rank among Buñuel''s most memorable (stigmatic children, crucified nuns) and hilarious (Jesus considering a good shave).

724,MON ONCLE,"Slapstick prevails again when Jacques Tati’s eccentric, old-fashioned hero, Monsieur Hulot, is set loose in Villa Arpel, the geometric, oppressively ultramodern home of his brother-in-law, and in the antiseptic plastic hose factory where he gets a job. The second Hulot movie and Tati’s first color film,Mon oncleis a supremely amusing satire of mechanized living and consumer society that earned the director the Academy Award for best foreign-language film.",Jacques Tati,France,1958,French,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/0a436dbf0865b63393c35846b989ba4c/cofkAT1oceBnZHsOyale1NmIJZ2Omj_large.jpg,0050706
725,MON ONCLE ANTOINE,"Claude Jutra''s evocative portrait of a boy''s coming of age in wintry 1940s rural Quebec has been consistently cited by critics and scholars as the greatest Canadian film of all time. Delicate, naturalistic, and tinged with a striking mix of nostalgia and menace,Mon oncle Antoinefollows Benoit, as he first encounters the twin terrors of sex and death, and his fellow villagers, who are living under the thumb of the local asbestos mine owner. Set during one ominous Christmas,Mon oncle Antoineis a holiday film unlike any other, and an authentically detailed illustration of childhood’s twilight.",Claude Jutra,Canada,1971,French,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/c01567fcc8a39f8e154f50430cc986ce/7oJP4owWJH4wIE4qROgEus6jB0HRFb_large.jpg,0067439
726,MONSIEUR HULOT’S HOLIDAY,"Monsieur Hulot, Jacques Tati’s endearing clown, takes a holiday at a seaside resort, where his presence provokes one catastrophe after another. Tati’s masterpiece of gentle slapstick is a series of effortlessly well-choreographed sight gags involving dogs, boats, and firecrackers; it was the first entry in the Hulot series and the film that launched its maker to international stardom.",Jacques Tati,France,1953,French,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/2d61eabe4e6c3f807bf33eb2ca772c5b/Jgz5xA9nzj8AMHZkq936OqiiYrrY1Q_large.jpg,0046487
727,MONSIEUR VERDOUX,"Charlie Chaplin plays shockingly against type in his most controversial film, a brilliant and bleak black comedy about money, marriage, and murder. Chaplin is a twentieth-century bluebeard, an enigmatic family man who goes to extreme lengths to support his wife and child, attempting to bump off a series of wealthy widows (including one played by the indefatigable Martha Raye, in a hilarious performance). This deeply philosophical and wildly entertaining film is a work of true sophistication, both for the moral questions it dares to ask and for the way it deconstructs its megastar’s lovable on-screen persona.",Charles Chaplin,United States,1947,English,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/441caaad467950ef83c88bdc1b9badcb/yL1YbMO1jXLnbQqg6oOyri2mB2kdj9_large.jpg,0039631

730,MONTEREY POP,"On a beautiful June weekend in 1967, at the beginning of the Summer of Love, the Monterey International Pop Festival roared forward, capturing a decade’s spirit and ushering in a new era of rock and roll. Monterey featured career-making performances by Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, and Otis Redding, but they were just a few of the performers in a wildly diverse lineup that included Simon and Garfunkel, the Mamas and the Papas, the Who, the Byrds, Hugh Masekela, and the extraordinary Ravi Shankar. With his characteristic vérité style—and a camera crew that included the likes of Albert Maysles and Richard Leacock—D. A.

731,MONTY PYTHON’S LIFE OF BRIAN,"After slaying the Arthurian legend in their now classic Holy Grail, the Pythons set their sights on the Greatest Story Ever Told. Blind faith, virgin birth, crucifixion—nothing is sacred in this epic send-up of ancient times, which draws on the cornball biblical blockbusters of the 1950s to lampoon celebrity culture in any era.

As the police close in around him, Danny makes a desperate bid for the love of the dead man’s fiancée (Gail Russell), a schoolteacher who sees the wounded soul behind his aggression. With this postwar comeback, Borzage recaptured the inspiration that had animated his long and audacious early career, marrying the lyrical force of his romantic

736,THE MOST BEAUTIFUL,"This portrait of female volunteer workers at an optics plant during World War II, shot on location at the Nippon Kogaku factory, was created with a patriotic agenda.

Faced with a dying mother, an absent, alcoholic father, and a baby brother in need of care, the teenage Mouchette seeks solace in nature and daily routine, a respite from her economic and pubescent turmoil.

740,MR. FREEDOM,"William Klein moved into more blatantly political territory with this hilarious, vicious Vietnam-era lampoon of imperialist American foreign policy. Mr. Freedom (John Abbey), a bellowing good-ol''-boy superhero decked out in copious football padding, jets to France to cut off a Commie invasion from Switzerland. A destructive, arrogant patriot in tight pants, Freedom joins forces with Marie Madeleine (a satirically sexy Delphine Seyrig) to combat lefty freethinkers, as well as the insidious evildoers Moujik Man and inflatable Red China Man, culminating in a star-spangled showdown of kitschy excess.

THANK YOU,"Hiroshi Shimizu’s endearing road movie follows the long and winding route of a sweet-natured bus driver—nicknamed Mr. Thank You for his constant exclamation to pedestrians who kindly step out of his way—traveling from rural Izu to Tokyo.

743,MULTIPLE MANIACS,"John Waters’ gloriously grotesque second feature is replete with all manner of depravity, from robbery to murder to one of cinema’s most memorably blasphemous moments. Made on a shoestring budget in Waters’ native Baltimore, with the filmmaker taking on nearly every technical task, this gleeful mockery of the peace-and-love ethos of its era features the Cavalcade of Perversion, a traveling show mounted by a troupe of misfits whose shocking proclivities are topped only by those of their leader: the glammer-than-glam, larger-than-life Divine, out for blood after discovering her lover’s affair.

There, with the help of the warmhearted eccentrics who populate the town, the boy finds both refuge from his misfortunes and unexpected adventure.

Meanwhile, her stepson is tormented by his own ghosts, related to his service in France’s recently ended war in Algeria.

747,THE MUSIC ROOM,"WithThe Music Room(Jalsaghar), Satyajit Ray brilliantly evokes the crumbling opulence of the world of a fallen aristocrat (the beloved actor Chhabi Biswas) desperately clinging to a fading way of life. His greatest joy is the music room in which he has hosted lavish concerts over the years—now a shadow of its former vivid self.

748,MY BEAUTIFUL LAUNDRETTE,"Stephen Frears was at the forefront of the British cinematic revival of the mid-1980s, and the delightfully transgressiveMy Beautiful Laundretteis his greatest triumph of the period. Working from a richly layered script by Hanif Kureishi, who was soon to be an internationally renowned writer, Frears tells an uncommon love story that takes place between a young South London Pakistani man (Gordon Warnecke), who decides to open an upscale laundromat to make his family proud, and his childhood friend, a skinhead (Daniel Day-Lewis, in a breakthrough role) who volunteers to help make his dream a reality. This culture-clash comedy is also a subversive work of social realism that dares to address racism, homophobia, and sociopolitical marginalization in Margaret Thatcher’s England.",Stephen Frears,United Kingdom,1985,English,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/17f96f9413ad320378ac50cede624921/tLddExzFtpz7o13GYWsutsVfFGrWiq_large.jpg,0091578
767,NAQOYQATSI,"Godfrey Reggio takes on the digital revolution in the final chapter of hisQatsi Trilogy.Through a variety of cinematic techniques, including slow motion, time-lapse, computer- generated imagery, and found footage, the film tells of a world that has completed the transition from the natural to the artificial. Globalization has been accomplished, all of our interactions are technologically mediated, and all images are manipulated. From this (virtual) reality, Reggio sculpts a frenetic yet ruminative portrait of an era in which the cacophony of “communication” has rendered humankind effectively postlanguage.",Godfrey Reggio,United States,2002,,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/9c3624e50b6bdfc76e35e76630ac2a92/hq6ior2POJCOfpMPkqBOtsQ44AOR7o_large.jpg,0145937
749,MY BRILLIANT CAREER,"For her award-winning breakthrough film, director Gillian Armstrong drew on teenage author Miles Franklin’s novel, a celebrated turn-of-the-twentieth-century Australian coming-of-age story, to brashly upend the conventions of period romance. Headstrong young Sybylla Melvyn (Judy Davis, in a star-making performance), bemoans her stifling life in the backcountry, where her writerly ambitions receive little encouragement, and craves independence above all else. When a handsome landowner (Sam Neill), disarmed by her unruly charms, begins to court her, Sybylla must decide whether she can reconcile the prospect of marriage with the illustrious life’s work she has imagined for herself. Suffused with generous humor and a youthful appetite for experience,My Brilliant Careeris a luminous portrait of an ardently free spirit.",Gillian Armstrong,Australia,1979,English,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/1076892f9021ddb7c859fd3c8e320e2a/Ci81X9eJjj5UeZxOsh0yqJlCk9CGOm_large.jpg,0079596
750,MY CRASY LIFE,"Jean-Pierre Gorin’s gripping and unique film about a Samoan street gang in Long Beach, California, is, like other works by the filmmaker, a probing look at a closed community with its own rules, rituals, and language.

751,MY DARLING CLEMENTINE,"John Ford takes on the legend of the O.K. Corral shoot-out in this multilayered, exceptionally well-constructed western, one of the director’s very best films. Henry Fonda cuts an iconic figure as Wyatt Earp, the sturdy lawman who sets about the task of shaping up the disorderly Arizona town of Tombstone, and Victor Mature gives the performance of his career as the boozy, tubercular gambler and gunman Doc Holliday. Though initially at cross-purposes, the pair ultimately team up to confront the violent Clanton gang.

752,MY DINNER WITH ANDRÉ,"In this captivating and philosophical film directed by Louis Malle, actor and playwright Wallace Shawn sits down with his friend the theater director André Gregory at a restaurant on New York’s Upper West Side, and the pair proceed through an alternately whimsical and despairing confessional about love, death, money, and all the superstition in between. Playing variations on their own New York–honed personas, Shawn and Gregory, who also cowrote the screenplay, dive in with introspective intellectual gusto, and Malle captures it all with a delicate, artful detachment. A fascinating freeze-frame of cosmopolitan culture,My Dinner with Andréremains a unique work in cinema history.",Louis Malle,United States,1981,English,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/55540be3417fc8d3aca18151f48009d7/1wrYMIHOtZzcuJuYju1L7NYD14iLdR_large.jpg,0082783
754,MY MAN GODFREY,"Carole Lombard and William Powell dazzle in this definitive screwball comedy by Gregory La Cava—a potent cocktail of romantic repartee and social critique. Irene (Lombard), an eccentric, wealthy Manhattanite, wins a society-ball scavenger hunt after finding a “forgotten man” (Powell)—an apparent down-and-out drifter—at a dump. She gives him work as the family butler and soon falls head over heels for him. Her attempts to both woo Godfrey and indoctrinate him in the household’s dysfunction make for a string of madcap high jinks that has never been bested. La Cava’s deft film was the first to garner Oscar nominations in all four acting categories, and it is one of Hollywood’s greatest commentaries on class and the social unrest of the Depression era.",Gregory La Cava,United States,1936,English,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/faae05a1b170149a490b96749d940a7f/BeabnGRtbsbWPi0gQYY7xJClHmZjMg_large.jpg,0028010

A pious Catholic engineer in his early thirties, he lives by a strict moral code in order to rationalize his world, drowning himself in mathematics and the philosophy of Pascal. After spotting the delicate, blonde Françoise at Mass, he vows to make her his wife, although when he unwittingly spends the night at the apartment of the bold, brunette divorcée Maud, his rigid ethical standards are challenged.

757,MYSTERIOUS OBJECT AT NOON,"Apichatpong Weerasethakul brought an appetite for experimen­tation to Thai cinema with his debut feature, an uncategorizable work that refracts documentary impressions of his homeland through the surrealist concept of the exquisite corpse game. Enlisting locals to contribute improvised narration to a simple tale, Apichatpong charts the collective construction of the fiction as each new encounter imbues it with unpredictable shades of fantasy and pathos. Shot over the course of two years in 16 mm black and white,Mysterious Object at Noonestablished the director’s fascination with the porous boundaries between the real and the imagined.Mysterious Object at Noonwas restored in 2013 by the Austrian Film Museum and the Cineteca di Bologna/L’Immagine Ritrovata laboratory, in association with The Film Foundation’s World Cinema Project, LISTO laboratory in Vienna, Technicolor Ltd. in Bangkok, and Apichatpong Weerasethakul.

Rejecting anyone who might care for him, the volcanic Johnny hurls himself around London on a nocturnal odyssey, colliding with a succession of other desperate and dispossessed people and scorching everyone in his path. With a virtuoso script and raw performances from Thewlis and costars Katrin Cartlidge and Lesley Sharp, Leigh’s depiction of England’s underbelly is an amalgam of black comedy and doomsday prophecy that took the best director and best actor prizes at the 1993 Cannes Film Festival.",Mike Leigh,United Kingdom,1993,English,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/ad92e3359b1dde6cd670b3f36c5ddf08/YQZ7RpGqF3uncaRrdKPcrnU0K6LDKE_large.jpg,0107653

A lone marksman (Wilde) is released, without clothes or weapons, to be hunted for sport, and he begins a harrowing journey through savanna and jungle back to a primitive state.

Robeson committed his support to Paul Strand and Leo Hurwitz''s political semidocumentaryNative Land.

Movie legends Max von Sydow and Liv Ullmann give remarkably authentic performances as Karl Oskar and Kristina, a couple who meet with one physical and emotional trial after another on their arduous journey. The precise, minute detail with which Troell depicts their story—which is also that of countless other people who sought better lives across the Atlantic—is a wonder to behold.

Romero, is a great story of independent cinema: a midnight hit turned box-office smash that became one of the most influential films of all time. A deceptively simple tale of a group of strangers trapped in a farmhouse who find themselves fending off a horde of recently dead, flesh-eating ghouls, Romero’s claustrophobic vision of a late-1960s America literally tearing itself apart rewrote the rules of the horror genre, combined gruesome gore with acute social commentary, and quietly broke ground by casting a black actor (Duane Jones) in its lead role.

795,OLD JOY,"Two old friends reunite for a quietly revelatory overnight camping trip in this breakout feature from Kelly Reichardt, a microbudget study of character and masculinity that introduced many viewers to one of contemporary American cinema’s most independent artists. As expectant father Mark (Daniel London) and nomadic Kurt (Will Oldham) travel by car and foot into the woods in search of some secluded hot springs, their fumbling attempts to reconnect keep butting up against the limits of their friendship and the reality of how much their paths have diverged since their shared youth.

797,ONE-EYED JACKS,"This is a western like no other, combining the mythological scope of that most American of genres with the searing naturalism of a performance by Marlon Brando—all suffused with Freudian overtones and masculine anxiety. In his only directing stint, Brando captures rugged coastal and desert landscapes in gorgeous widescreen, Technicolor images, and elicits from his fellow actors (including Karl Malden and Pina Pellicer) nuanced depictions of conflicted characters. Though the production was overwhelmed by its director’s perfectionism and plagued by setbacks and studio reediting,One-Eyed Jacksstands as one of Brando’s great achievements, thanks above all to his tortured turn as Rio, a bank robber bent on revenge against his former partner in crime. Brooding and romantic, Rio is the last and perhaps the most tender of the iconic outsiders that the great actor imbued with such intensity throughout his career.",Marlon Brando,United States,1961,English,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/d1660ab865457458f4d72ee7f429a42a/NA3VDZzOh4GhSWZO77GnTz9i9U8JcF_large.jpg,0055257

The violent reality in which Ofelia lives merges seamlessly with her fantastical interior world when she meets a faun in a decaying labyrinth and is set on a strange, mythic journey that is at once terrifying and beautiful.

828,THE PASSION OF JOAN OF ARC,"Spiritual rapture and institutional hypocrisy come to stark, vivid life in one of the most transcendent masterpieces of the silent era. Chronicling the trial of Joan of Arc in the hours leading up to her execution, Danish master Carl Theodor Dreyer depicts her torment with startling immediacy, employing an array of techniques—expressionistic lighting, interconnected sets, painfully intimate close-ups—to immerse viewers in her subjective experience.

A depiction of rural Bengali life in a style inspired by Italian neorealism, this naturalistic but poetic evocation of a number of years in the life of a family introduces us to both little Apu and, just as essentially, the women who will help shape him: his independent older sister, Durga; his harried mother, Sarbajaya, who, with her husband away, must hold the family together; and his kindly and mischievous elderly “auntie,” Indir—vivid, multifaceted characters all.

831,PATRIOTISM,"Playwright and novelist Yukio Mishima foreshadowed his own violent suicide with this ravishing short feature, his only foray into filmmaking, yet made with the expressiveness and confidence of a true cinema artist. All prints ofPatriotism(Yûkoku), which depicts the seppuku of an army officer, were destroyed after Mishima''s death in 1970, though the negative was saved, and the film resurfaced thirty-five years later.

Ulmer and future Oscar winners Billy Wilder  and Fred Zinnemann—worked together on the once-in-a-lifetime collaborationPeople on Sunday(Menschen am Sonntag). This effervescent, sunlit silent, about a handful of city dwellers (a charming cast of nonprofessionals) enjoying a weekend outing, offers a rare glimpse of Weimar-era Berlin.

In the first of a series of legendary performances for Bergman, Liv Ullmann plays a stage actor who has inexplicably gone mute; an equally mesmerizing Bibi Andersson is the garrulous young nurse caring for her in a remote island cottage.

So says the legend that drivesThe Phantom Carriage(Körkarlen), directed by the father of Swedish cinema, Victor Sjöström. The story, based on a novel by Nobel Prize winner Selma Lagerlöf, concerns an alcoholic, abusive ne’er-do-well (Sjöström himself) who is shown the error of his ways, and the pure-of-heart Salvation Army sister who believes in his redemption.

Featuring an elegant soiree with guests seated at toilet bowls, poker-playing monks using religious medals as chips, and police officers looking for a missing girl who is right under their noses, this perverse, playfully absurd comedy of non sequiturs deftly compiles many of the themes that preoccupied Buñuel throughout his career—from the hypocrisy of conventional morality to the arbitrariness of social arrangements.",Luis Buñuel,France,1974,French,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/fdad490419134d13dcb5ed649c728638/mKigRc2tBPTYvxibGfFFtKMoEJwREY_large.jpg,0071487
843,THE PHILADELPHIA STORY,"With this furiously witty comedy of manners, Katharine Hepburn revitalized her career and cemented her status as the era’s most iconic leading lady—thanks in great part to her own shrewd orchestrations. While starring in the Philip Barry stage playThe Philadelphia Story,Hepburn acquired the screen rights, handpicking her friend George Cukor to direct. The intoxicating screenplay by Donald Ogden Stewart pits the formidable Philadelphia socialite Tracy Lord (Hepburn, at her most luminous) against various romantic foils, chief among them her charismatic ex-husband (Cary Grant), who disrupts her imminent marriage by paying her family estate a visit, accompanied by a tabloid reporter on assignment to cover the wedding of the year (James Stewart, in his only Academy Award–winning performance).

Without recognizing her, he enlists her to play his wife in a bizarre hall-of-shattered-mirrors story that is as richly metaphorical as it is preposterously engrossing.

Haneke finds his match in Isabelle Huppert, who delivers an icy but quietly seething performance as Erika, a piano professor at a Viennese conservatory who lives with her mother in a claustrophobically codepen­dent relation­ship. Severely repressed, she satisfies her mas­ochistic urges only voyeuristically until she meets Walter (Benoît Magimel), a student whose desire for Erika leads to a destructive infatuation that upsets the careful equilibrium of her life.

Based on an acclaimed 1967 novel by Joan Lindsay,Picnic at Hanging Rockis set at the turn of the twentieth century and concerns a small group of students from an all- female college who vanish, along with a chaperone, while on a St. Valentine’s Day outing. Less a mystery than a journey into the mystic, as well as an inquiry into issues of class and sexual repression in Australian society, Weir’s gorgeous, disquieting film is a work of poetic horror whose secrets haunt viewers to this day.",Peter Weir,Australia,1975,English,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/5579f18bb8774e54eaf15f9165f667fa/sasYypNL09rJkL5PuKgVY6aVMkUGUd_large.jpg,0073540
849,PIERROT LE FOU,"Dissatisfied in marriage and life, Ferdinand (Jean-Paul Belmondo) takes to the road with the babysitter, his ex-lover Marianne Renoir (Anna Karina), and leaves the bourgeoisie behind. Yet this is no normal road trip: genius auteur Jean-Luc Godard''s tenth feature in six years is a stylish mash-up of consumerist satire, politics, and comic-book aesthetics, as well as a violent, zigzag tale of, as Godard called them, the last romantic couple. With blissful color imagery by cinematographer Raoul Coutard and Belmondo and Karina at their most animated,Pierrot le fouis one of the high points of the French New Wave, and was Godard''s last frolic before he moved ever further into radical cinema.",Jean-Luc Godard,France,1965,French,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/cd633db777351aee1b7444b7a50cad07/aOUxsNMCS7uo0DkdShLeSHLNL58fXv_large.jpg,0059592

A long-planned film collaboration between the director and the choreographer was in preproduction when Bausch died in 2009. Two years later, Wenders decided to go ahead with the project, reconceiving it as an homage to his late friend. The result, shot in stunning 3D, is a remarkable visual experience and a vivid representation of Bausch’s art, enacted by a group of staggeringly talented dancers from her company, the Tanztheater Wuppertal Pina Bausch.Pinais an adventurous work of cinema that highlights the bold legacy of one of the world’s true creative visionaries.",Wim Wenders,Germany,2011,"German,                                          English,                                          Russian,                                          French,                                          Italian,                                          Spanish,                                          Portuguese,                                          Korean,                                          Slovene",https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/cd5973acd191096c3ae89fd48ab276ae/h8whcQ976XNpXAoGee6abfjH5sObcs_large.jpg,1440266

Made up of mesmerizing scenes of Russell and his band performing, both in concert and in the studio, as well as off-the-cuff moments behind the scenes, this singular film—which also features performances by Willie Nelson and George Jones—has attained legendary status over the years.

860,LA POINTE COURTE,"The great Agnès Varda''s film career began with this graceful, penetrating study of a marriage on the rocks, set against the backdrop of a small Mediterranean fishing village. Both a stylized depiction of the complicated relationship between a married couple (played by Silvia Monfort and Philippe Noiret) and a documentary-like look at the daily struggles of the locals, Varda''s discursive, gorgeously filmed debut was radical enough to later be considered one of the progenitors of the coming French New Wave.",Agnès Varda,France,1956,French,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/901f7dec50c95a3d501f8ad73daa9b6b/qqJLlCyvWCbKOhkBYLalNrBSZdVUa0_large.jpg,0048499

861,LA POISON,"The writer, actor, and director Sacha Guitry emerged from the theater to become one of France’s best-known and most inventive filmmakers, andLa poisonmarked his first major collaboration with another titan of the screen, the incomparably expressive Michel Simon. With Guitry’s witty dialogue and fleet pacing, this black comedy is the quintessential depiction of a marriage gone sour: after thirty years together, a village gardener (Simon) and his wife (Germaine Reuver) find themselves contemplating how to do away with each other, with the former even planning how he’ll negotiate his eventual criminal trial. Inspired by Guitry’s own post–World War II tangle with the law—a wrongful charge of collaborationism—La poisonis a blithely caustic broadside against the French legal system and a society all too eager to capitalize on the misfortunes of others.",Sacha Guitry,France,1951,French,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/a1286c4c98cc8ba8cc05f51863d5cd75/pIDIjdA3TGgIYFHhLLzkwffCZvxZE1_large.jpg,0043927

From time to time, Haru shares her bed with Subu, though she believes her dead husband, reincarnated as a carp, disapproves. Director Shohei Imamura has always delighted in the kinky exploits of lowlifes, and in this 1966 classic, he finds subversive humor in the bizarre dynamics of Haru, her Oedipal son, and her daughter, the true object of her pornographer-boyfriend''s obsession.

The wedding plans are interrupted, however, by a mysterious pirate, a vengeful Spaniard, and a good-natured giant, in a tale full of swashbuckling, romance, and outrageously hilarious spoofery.

After having faked his own death and escaped Seville, the aging lothario returns, only to find that he has been promptly forgotten; perhaps Merle Oberon’s raven-haired beauty can coax him back into business.

Toshiro Mifune, in his last role for Kurosawa, gives a powerhouse performance as the dignified yet empathic director who guides his pupil to maturity, teaching the embittered intern to appreciate the lives of his destitute patients.

892,RED DESERT,"Michelangelo Antonioni’s 1960s panoramas of contemporary alienation were decade-defining artistic events, andRed Desert,his first color film, is perhaps his most epochal. This provocative look at the spiritual desolation of the technological age—about a disaffected woman, brilliantly portrayed by Antonioni muse Monica Vitti, wandering through a bleak industrial landscape beset by power plants and environmental toxins, and tentatively flirting with her husband’s coworker, played by Richard Harris—continues to keep viewers spellbound. With one startling, painterly composition after another—of abandoned fishing cottages, electrical towers, looming docked ships—Red Desertcreates a nearly apocalyptic image of its time, and confirms Antonioni as cinema’s preeminent poet of the modern age.",Michelangelo Antonioni,"France,                                              Italy",1964,Italian,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/f0698d10e7f1a77dd8e328a8ea94797f/Vd8Khg2Vd5KoE8hVxNrGs10PHkZAgZ_large.jpg,0058003

894,RED RIVER,"No matter what genre he worked in, Howard Hawks played by his own rules, and never was this more evident than in his first western, the rowdy and whip-smartRed River.In it, John Wayne found one of his greatest roles, as an embittered, tyrannical Texas rancher whose tensions with his independent-minded adopted son—played by Montgomery Clift, in a breakout performance—reach epic proportions during a cattle drive to Missouri. The film is based on a novel that dramatizes the real-life late nineteenth-century expeditions along the Chisholm Trail, but Hawks is less interested in historical accuracy than in tweaking the codes of masculinity that propel the myths of the American West.

923,THE ROSE,"Bette Midler exploded onto the screen with her take-no-prisoners performance in this quintessential film about fame and addiction from director Mark Rydell. Midler is the rock-and-roll singer Mary Rose Foster (known as the Rose to her legions of fans), whose romantic relationships and mental health are continuously imperiled by the demands of life on the road. Incisively scripted and beautifully shot—by Vilmos Zsigmond, with assistance on the dazzling concert scenes by a host of other world-class cinematographers, including Conrad L. Hall, László Kovács, Owen Roizman, and Haskell Wexler—this is a sensitively drawn and emotionally overwhelming melodrama that made the popular singer into a movie star as well.",Mark Rydell,United States,1979,English,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/a9dfda8b8db438e46c784cf5c4c866d6/1hFFNNJHOVyul0OLXpKgpcKM2MOF6S_large.jpg,19788500

This wildly entertaining nightmare, faithfully adapted from Ira Levin’s best seller, stars a revelatory Mia Farrow as a young mother-to-be who grows increasingly suspicious that her overfriendly elderly neighbors (played by Sidney Blackmer and an Oscar-winning Ruth Gordon) and self-involved husband (John Cassavetes) are hatching a satanic plot against her and her baby.

925,ROSETTA,"The Belgian filmmaking team of brothers Luc and Jean-Pierre Dardenne turned heads withRosetta,an intense vérité drama that closely follows a poor young woman struggling to hold on to a job to support herself and her alcoholic mother. It’s a swift and simple tale made revelatory by the raw, empathetic way in which the directors render Rosetta’s desperation, keeping the camera nearly perched on her shoulder throughout. Many have copied the Dardennes’ style, but few have equaled it.

926,ROUTINE PLEASURES,"What do a club devoted to model trains and the legendary film critic and painter Manny Farber have in common? These two lines intersect in Jean-Pierre Gorin’s lovely and distinctly American film, which takes as its subject the desire to re-create the past (the locomotive aficionados’ elaborate worlds in miniature, Farber’s teeming canvases) and expands to something richly philosophical and surprisingly funny.Routine Pleasuresis a masterful meditation on America’s landscapes, real and imagined.",Jean-Pierre Gorin,United States,1986,English,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/e37cc813ca976b63dbf5c514ad769717/URceRh7EdKTD4WasARAjk9rsxkgau1_large.jpg,0274069

Chas (Ben Stiller) started buying real estate in his early teens and seemed to have an almost preternatural understanding of international finance. Margot (Gwyneth Paltrow) was a playwright and received a Braverman Grant of $50,000 in the ninth grade. Richie (Luke Wilson) was a junior champion tennis player and won the U.S. Nationals three years in a row.

928,THE RULES OF THE GAME,"Considered one of the greatest films ever made,The Rules of the Game(La règle du jeu), by Jean Renoir, is a scathing critique of corrupt French society cloaked in a comedy of manners in which a weekend at a marquis’ country château lays bare some ugly truths about a group of haut bourgeois acquaintances. The film has had a tumultuous history: it was subjected to cuts after the violent response of the premiere audience in 1939, and the original negative was destroyed during World War II; it wasn’t reconstructed until 1959.

929,THE RULING CLASS,"Peter O’Toole gives a tour-de-force performance as Jack, a man “cured” of believing he’s God—only to become Jack the Ripper incarnate. Based on Peter Barnes''s irreverent play, this darkly comic indictment of Britain’s class system peers behind the closed doors of English aristocracy.

930,RUMBLE FISH,"In this deeply personal tale of estrangement and reconciliation between two rebellious brothers, set in a dreamlike and timeless Tulsa, Francis Ford Coppola gives mythic dimensions to intimate, painful emotions.

Hinton’s work in a single year, after the more classically styledThe Outsiders.Graced with a remarkable cast headed by Matt Dillon, Mickey Rourke, and Diane Lane; haunting black-and-white visuals that hark back to German expressionism and forward to Coppola’s ownTetro;and a powerful percussive score by Stewart Copeland that underlines the movie’s romantic fatalism,Rumble Fishpulsates throughout with genuine love and dread.",Francis Ford Coppola,United States,1983,English,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/28b1b85a6f4119f34d6165c5256037f6/CGCMTOMzrmzXe1qXr6Mnpt4jXgsgi0_large.jpg,0086216
931,RUSHMORE,"The dazzling sophomore film from Wes Anderson is equal parts coming-of-age story, French New Wave homage, and screwball comedy. Tenth grader Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman) is Rushmore Academy’s most extracurricular student—and its least scholarly. He faces expulsion and enters into unlikely friendships with both a lovely first-grade teacher (Olivia Williams) and a melancholy self-made millionaire (Bill Murray, in an award-winning performance).

After the doctors she sees can give her no clear diagnosis, she comes to believe that she has frighteningly extreme environmental allergies. A profoundly unsettling work from the great American director Todd Haynes,Safefunctions on multiple levels: as a prescient commentary on self-help culture, as a metaphor for the AIDS crisis, as a drama about class and social estrangement, and as a horror film about what you cannot see.

And with its torrent of perfectly executed gags and astonishing stunts,Safety Last!is the perfect introduction to him. Lloyd plays a small-town bumpkin trying to make it in the big city, who finds employment as a lowly department-store clerk. He comes up with a wild publicity stunt to draw attention to the store, resulting in an incredible feat of derring-do on his part that gets him started on the climb to success.

A vivid evocation of midcentury malaise that unfolds against a backdrop of cheap motels, smoky diners, and suburban living rooms,Salesmanassumes poignant dimensions as it uncovers the way its subjects’ fast-talking bravado masks frustration, disappointment, and despair.

Shooting on 16 mm for a mere $3,000, writer-producer-director Linklater and his crew of friends threw out any idea of a traditional plot, choosing instead to create a tapestry of over a hundred characters, each as compelling as the last.Slackeris a prescient look at an emerging generation of aggressive nonparticipants, and one of the key films of the American independent film movement of the 1990s.",Richard Linklater,United States,1991,English,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/952711c7e159f884b072e6afdbb4d9ae/aHl7gHVts3vg6wGhjYlyRYGlJCDWOn_large.jpg,0102943

The unassuming Jean Desailly is perfectly cast as a celebrated literary scholar, seemingly happily married, who embarks on an affair with a gorgeous stewardess, played by Françoise Dorléac, who is captivated by his charm and reputation. As their romance gets serious, the film grows anxious, leading to a wallop of a conclusion.

Startlingly modern in its frankness and psychological realism, the film represents one of the purest on-screen expressions of the sensibility of the intimate community of artists around New York’s Actors Studio, which transformed American cinema in the mid-twentieth century.

He finally finds his true calling when he becomes determined to help save the city’s last horse-drawn streetcar, which is operated by his sweetheart’s crusty grandfather.

1011,THE SPY WHO CAME IN FROM THE COLD,"The acclaimed, best-selling novel by John le Carré, about a Cold War spy on one final dangerous mission in East Germany, is transmuted by director Martin Ritt into a film every bit as precise and ruthless as the book. Richard Burton is superb

A hired guide—the Stalker—leads a writer and a professor into the heart of the Zone, the restricted site of a long-ago disaster, where the three men eventually zero in on the Room, a place rumored to fulfill one’s most deeply held desires. Adapting a science-fiction novel by Arkady and Boris Strugatsky, Tarkovsky created an immersive world with a wealth of material detail and a sense of organic atmosphere.

1016,THE STEEL HELMET,"The Steel Helmetmarked Samuel Fuller''s official arrival as a mighty cinematic force. Despite its relatively low budget, this portrait of Korean War soldiers dealing with moral and racial identity crises remains one of the director''s most gripping, realistic depictions of the blood and guts of war, as well as a reflection of Fuller''s irreducible social conscience.

Rather than focus on big dramatic moments, Kore-eda relies on simple gestures and domestic routines (especially cooking) to evoke a family’s entire life, its deep regrets and its daily joys.

With its unapologetic identification with social outcasts and its sensitive, modern approach to matters of sexuality and race, Richardson’s classic is a still startling benchmark work of realism.",Tony Richardson,United Kingdom,1961,English,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/7bfaa9a3f92e2fc8b4cc5f8b3a72fcd4/sAyvt3qLGVUlBaHDDLG1vMF24HKrUk_large.jpg,0055506
1061,TEOREMA,"One of the iconoclastic Pier Paolo Pasolini’s most radical provocations,Teoremafinds the auteur moving beyond the poetic, proletarian earthiness that first won him renown and notoriety with a coolly cryptic exploration of bourgeois spiritual emptiness. Terence Stamp stars as the mysterious stranger—perhaps an angel, perhaps a devil—who, one by one, seduces the members of a wealthy Milanese family (including European cinema icons Silvana Mangano, Massimo Girotti, Laura Betti, and Anne Wiazemsky), precipitating an existential crisis in each of their lives. Unfolding nearly wordlessly in a procession of sacred and profane images, this tantalizing metaphysical riddle—blocked from exhibition by the Catholic Church for degeneracy—is at once a blistering Marxist treatise on sex, religion, and art and a primal scream into the void.",Pier Paolo Pasolini,Italy,1969,Italian,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/56166014193fe00f622115685dba2487/g6y2g4zZHy2J3caJizYcgZBfh7FnQ9_large.jpg,0063678

This film marked the return of director Ishiro Honda, who had retired years earlier, disheartened by the increasingly kid-friendly approach of the series. For this final entry, Honda steers the King of the Monsters back into grim territory, interweaving an alien-invasion plot with a tale of tragic romance.New cover illustration by Chris Wisnia",Ishiro Honda,Japan,1975,Japanese,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/8fa6755916b32ef7098b57550a72ea08/9NH9clK8dPpEO6houf2zTXuBMCBkw1_large.jpg,0073373

This fateful visit commences an epic narrative of sex, class, betrayal, and revenge, which Polanski unfolds with deliberation and finesse.

MABUSE,"Locked away in an asylum for a decade and teetering between life and death, the criminal mastermind Doctor Mabuse (Rudolf Klein-Rogge) has scribbled his last will and testament: a manifesto establishing a future empire of crime. When the document’s nefarious writings start leading to terrifying parallels in reality, it’s up to Berlin’s star detective, Inspector Lohmann (Otto Wernicke, reprising his role fromM) to connect the most fragmented, maddening clues in a case unlike any other. A sequel to his enormously successful silent filmDr. Mabuse: The Gambler, Fritz Lang''sThe Testament of Dr. Mabusereunites the director with the character that had effectively launched his career. Lang put slogans and ideas expounded by the Nazis into the mouth of a madman, warning his audience of an imminent menace, which was soon to become a reality. Nazi Minister of Information Joseph Goebbels saw the film as an instruction manual for terrorist action against the government and banned it for “endangering public order and security.” A landmark of mystery and suspense for countless espionage and noir thrillers to come, this is the complete, uncut original director’s version in a stunning new transfer.",Fritz Lang,Germany,1933,German,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/54c721d65e42f080484dba5bb409daf0/j2sPOa4CCiMyJefg5DNy4uJraAbCCe_large.jpg,0023563

1069,THAT OBSCURE OBJECT OF DESIRE,"Luis Buñuel’s final film explodes with eroticism, bringing full circle the director’s lifelong preoccupation with the darker side of desire. Buñuel regular Fernando Rey plays Mathieu, an urbane widower, tortured by his lust for the elusive Conchita. With subversive flare, Buñuel uses two different actresses in the lead—Carole Bouquet, a sophisticated French beauty, and Angela Molina, a Spanish coquette. Drawn from Pierre Louÿs’s 1898 novel,La Femme et le Pantin, That Obscure Object of Desireis a dizzying game of sexual politics punctuated by a terror that harkens back to Buñuel’s brilliant surrealistic beginnings.",Luis Buñuel,France,1977,French,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/9c472c2c34b9a10676686ab6cd0fc33c/iY0kvMU1NZgd6bBZMfWcwjpWf75sWN_large.jpg,0075824

Renoir, working amidst the rise of Hitler and the Popular Front in France, had need to take license with the dark nature of Gorky''s source material, softening its bleak outlook. Kurosawa, firmly situated in the postwar world, found little reason for hope. He remained faithful to the original with its focus on the conflict between illusion and reality—a theme he would return to over and over again.

1076,THE THICK-WALLED ROOM,"Even early on in his directing career, Masaki Kobayashi didn’t shy away from controversy. Among the first Japanese films to deal directly with the scars of World War II, this drama about a group of rank-and-file Japanese soldiers jailed for crimes against humanity was adapted from the diaries of real prisoners.

1162,VICTIM,"An extraordinary performance by Dirk Bogarde grounds this intense, sobering indictment of early-sixties social intolerance and sexual puritanism. Bogarde plays Melville Farr, a married barrister who is one of a large group of closeted London men who become targets of a blackmailer.

The lovely Anna Karina, Godard’s greatest muse, plays Nana, a young Parisian who aspires to be an actress but instead ends up a prostitute, her downward spiral depicted in a series of discrete tableaux of daydreams and dances. Featuring some of Karina and Godard’s most iconic moments—from her movie theater vigil withThe Passion of Joan of Arcto her seductive pool-hall strut—Vivre sa vieis a landmark of the French New Wave that still surprises at every turn.",Jean-Luc Godard,France,1962,French,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/6c42e9306f69e2c84606a21ced97b83e/uRrrPBrhJfarv6LCJNGmDeomAoShvN_large.jpg,0056663

1164,LA VIE DE BOHÈME,"This deadpan tragicomedy about a group of impoverished, outcast artists living the bohemian life in Paris is among the most beguiling films by Finnish director Aki Kaurismäki. Based on stories from Henri Murger’s influential mid-nineteenth-century bookScènes de la vie de bohème(the basis for the operaLa bohème), the film features a marvelous trio of Kaurismäki regulars—André Wilms, Matti Pellonpää, and Karl Väänänen—as a writer, painter, and composer who scrape by together, sharing in life’s daily absurdities.

1165,LA VIE DE JÉSUS,"With his stunning debut feature, the risk-taking auteur Bruno Dumont immediately established his reputation as an uncompromising iconoclast on the cutting edge of French cinema. Blending unflinching realism with moments of startling, light-filled beauty,La vie de Jésusfinds unexpected philosophical richness in the quotidian, small-town existence of Freddy (nonprofessional David Douche in a revelatory, one-off performance), an aimless young man with epilepsy who, in his childlike simplicity, embodies both great tenderness and terrifying brutality.

1166,VIOLENCE AT NOON,"Violence at Noonconcerns the odd circumstances surrounding a horrific murder and rape spree. In a twist, the film is as much about the two women who protect the violent man—his wife and a former victim—as it is about him. Containing more than two thousand cuts and a wealth of inventive widescreen compositions, this coolly fragmented character study is a mesmerizing investigation of criminality and social decay.",Nagisa Oshima,Japan,1966,Japanese,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/01eb6087c76182f8ed720ab1fd2b4a16/l7uFRaowcYuOLzlxLaCNKQC9x6PWCL_large.jpg,0060486

With austere simplicity, the director tells the story of the rape and murder of the virgin Karin, and her father Töre’s ruthless pursuit of vengeance against the three killers.

An adaptation of Jeffrey Eugenides’s popular first novel,The Virgin Suicidesconjures the ineffable melancholy of teenage longing and ennui in its story of the suicides of the five Lisbon sisters, stifled by the rules of their overprotective religious parents—as told through the collective memory of a group of men who were boys at the time and still yearn to understand what happened. Evoking its 1970s suburban setting through ethereal cinematography by Ed Lachman and an atmospheric score by Air, the film secured a place for its director in the landscape of American independent cinema and has become a coming-of-age touchstone.",Sofia Coppola,United States,1999,English,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/dc3d5992049dae7c589492ccc81e1e18/9uRoyo4nyLZMomhprq1lNKVOXPXqel_large.jpg,0159097

Two strangers dressed as minstrels (Arletty and Alain Cuny) arrive at a castle in advance of court festivities—and are revealed to be emissaries of the devil, dispatched to spread heartbreak and suffering. Their plans, however, are thwarted by an unexpected intrusion: human love. Often interpreted as an allegory for the Nazi occupation of France, during which it was made,Les visiteurs du soir—wittily written by Jacques Prévert and Pierre Laroche, and elegantly designed by Alexandre Trauner and shot by Roger Hubert—is a moving tale of love conquering all.",Marcel Carné,France,1942,French,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/9652ba41ba3010b5ad0e0789b85764d2/JQ0SGEx168rQ7TFvY2pCLYgvwegQRP_large.jpg,0035521

1177,WALKER,"A hallucinatory biopic that breaks all cinematic conventions,Walker, from British director Alex Cox (Repo Man, Sid & Nancy), tells the story of nineteenth-century American adventurer William Walker (Ed Harris), who abandoned a series of careers in law, politics, journalism, and medicine to become a soldier of fortune, and for several years dictator of Nicaragua. Made with mad abandon and political acuity—and the support of the Sandinista army and government during the Contra war—the film uses this true tale as a satirical attack on American ultrapatriotism and a freewheeling condemnation of manifest destiny. Featuring a powerful score by Joe Strummer and a performance of intense, repressed rage by Harris,Walkerremains one of Cox''s most daring works.",Alex Cox,United States,1987,English,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/86ea8cdffe2ffc6cb71445896de49a4c/QAwC6uzFwSmQgZF84AIXSLdnvJ1XdI_large.jpg,11006642

1179,WANDA,"With her first and only feature film—a hard-luck drama she wrote, directed, and starred in—Barbara Loden turned in a groundbreaking work of American independent cinema, bringing to life a kind of character seldom seen on-screen. Set amid a soot-choked Pennsylvania landscape, and shot in an intensely intimate vérité style, the film takes up with distant and soft-spoken Wanda (Loden), who has left her husband, lost custody of her children, and now finds herself alone, drifting between dingy bars and motels, where she falls prey to a series of callous men—including a bank robber who ropes her into his next criminal scheme. An until now difficult-to-see masterpiece that has nonetheless exerted an outsize influence on generations of artists and filmmakers,Wandais a compassionate and wrenching portrait of a woman stranded on society’s margins.Wandawas restored by the UCLA Film & Television Archive.

Employing a cast of thousands and an array of innovative camera techniques, director Sergei Bondarchuk conjures a sweeping vision of grand balls that glitter with rococo beauty and breathtaking battles that overwhelm with their expressionistic power.

1181,THE WARPED ONES,"A juvenile delinquent gets out of the pen and immediately embarks on a rampage of untethered anger, most of it directed at the girlfriend of the journalist who helped send him up. Shot through with the same kind of bebop bravado that Godard was experimenting with half a world away, the anarchic descent into amoral madness that isThe Warped Ones(Kyonetsu no kisetsu) sounded a lost generation’s cry for help and was one of the films that kicked off Japan’s cinematic sixties with a bang.",Koreyoshi Kurahara,Japan,1960,Japanese,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/63c1d3d23fd7e5d09f234bfb35ad0d5e/wLzxV0KG25VUa13nCbz4rTOJsnPKWC_large.jpg,0057238

1183,THE WAR ROOM,"The 1992 presidential election was a triumph not only for Bill Clinton but also for the new breed of strategists who guided him to the White House—and changed the face of politics in the process. For this thrilling, behind-closed-doors account of that campaign, renowned cinema verité filmmakers Chris Hegedus and D. A. Pennebaker captured the brainstorming and bull sessions of Clinton’s crack team of consultants—especially James Carville and George Stephanopoulos, who became media stars in their own right as they injected a savvy, youthful spirit and spontaneity into the process of campaigning.

1184,WATERSHIP DOWN,"With this passion project, screenwriter-producer-director Martin Rosen brilliantly achieved what had been thought nearly impossible: a faithful big-screen adaptation of Richard Adams’s classic British dystopian novel about a community of rabbits under terrible threat from modern forces. With its naturalistic hand-drawn animation, dreamily expressionistic touches, gorgeously bucolic background design, and elegant voice work from such superb English actors as John Hurt, Ralph Richardson, Richard Briers, and Denholm Elliott,Watership Downis an emotionally arresting, dark-toned allegory about freedom amid political turmoil.",Martin Rosen,United States,1978,English,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/8b4a24dc151083e1944cd00788f9bce9/xkjdIN7aUqiWMSDdCXrwehCMSpuqJL_large.jpg,0078480

1187,WEEKEND,"This sensual, remarkably observed, beautifully acted wonder is the breakout feature from British writer-director-editor Andrew Haigh. Rarely has a film been as honest about sexuality—in both depiction and discussion—as this tale of a one-night stand that develops into a weekend-long idyll for two very different young men (exciting screen newcomers Tom Cullen and Chris New) in the English Midlands.

When the main event was delayed, extending Ali’s stay in Africa, Gast wound up amassing a treasure trove of footage, observing the wildly charismatic athlete training for one of the toughest bouts of his career while basking in his role as black America’s proud ambassador to postcolonial Africa.

As our young hero zigzags determinedly across two towns, aided (and sometimes misdirected) by those he encounters, his quest becomes both a revealing portrait of rural Iranian society in all its richness and complexity and a touching parable about the meaning of personal responsibility.

1193,WHITE DOG,"Samuel Fuller’s throat-grabbing exposé on American racism was misunderstood and withheld from release when it was made in the early eighties; today, the notorious film is lauded for its daring metaphor and gripping pulp filmmaking. Kristy McNichol stars as a young actress who adopts a lost German shepherd, only to discover through a series of horrifying incidents that the dog has been trained to attack black people, and Paul Winfield plays the animal trainer who tries to cure him.

1196,THE WHITE SHEIK,"Ivan Cavalli (Leopoldo Trieste) brings his new wife Wanda (Brunella Bovo) to Rome on the least romantic honeymoon in history, a rigid schedule of family meetings and audiences with the Pope. But Wanda, dreaming of the dashing hero of a photo-strip cartoon, drifts off in search of the White Sheik, thus setting off a slapstick comedy worthy of Chaplin. The style and themes which made Federico Fellini world famous are already apparent in this charming comedy (his first solo directorial effort), featuring such long-time collaborators as his wife, actress Giulietta Masina, and composer Nino Rota.",Federico Fellini,Italy,1952,Italian,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/06d0f05814fd5842699fa13b4018de5f/wyft9FFa1mhJiaRgrzJdBeo2OoeCRH_large.jpg,0044000
1197,"WHO ARE YOU, POLLY MAGGOO?","After nearly a decade as AmericanVogue''s most subversive fashion photographer, William Klein made this wild, pseudovérité incursion into the world of Parisian haute couture. Elegant, scathing humor ties together the various strands of this alternately glamorous and grotesque portrait of American in Paris Polly Maggoo (Dorothy MacGowan), an Alice in Wonderland supermodel who becomes the pinup plaything of media hounds and the fragmented fantasy of haunted Prince Igor (Sami Frey). Klein''s first fiction film is a daring deflation of cultural pretensions and institutions, dressed up in brilliant black and white.",William Klein,France,1966,French,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/3ddd1ecfba3af948c3b1f9e834792fd1/KmELnGBvCJjy7FapP6JcGa1AeHwjtx_large.jpg,0060879
1198,THE WICKED LADY,"Margaret Lockwood devours the screen as a tightly wound seventeenth-century beauty with loose morals, who steals her best friend’s wealthy fiancé on the eve of their wedding. And that’s only the beginning of this piece of pulp from director Leslie Arliss—there are no depths to which this sinful woman won’t sink. James Mason costars, and nearly steals the movie, as a highwayman with whom our antiheroine becomes entangled. This nasty, subversive treat was the most commercially successful of all the Gainsborough melodramas.",Leslie Arliss,United Kingdom,1945,English,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/772b7e5558887c5daed761fe8fd4153d/Y7bOdy6FLY9xSaO7A52u4izRfBkmmC_large.jpg,0086582

1201,WINGS,"For her first feature after graduating from the All-Russian State Institute for Cinematography (VGIK), Larisa Shepitko trained her lens on the fascinating Russian character actress Maya Bulgakova, who gives a marvelous performance as a once heroic Russian fighter pilot now living a quiet, disappointingly ordinary life as a school principal. Subtly portraying one woman’s desperation with elegant, spare camera work and casual, fluid storytelling, Shepitko, withWings, announced herself as an important new voice in Soviet cinema.",Larisa Shepitko,Soviet Union,1966,Russian,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/26978771306ada357db44a3679c882ba/1xZn3otJPOssptMlCLKBDIWkTfKgyu_large.jpg,0098948

Small-town pastor Tomas Ericsson (Gunnar Björnstrand) performs his duties mechanically before a dwindling congregation, including his stubbornly devoted lover, Märta (Ingrid Thulin). When he is asked to assuage a troubled parishioner’s (Max von Sydow) debilitating fear of nuclear annihilation, Tomas is terrified to find that he can provide nothing but his own doubt.

Brad Dourif, in an impassioned performance, is Hazel Motes, who, fresh out of the army, attempts to open the first Church Without Christ in the small town of Taulkinham. Populated with inspired performances that seem to spring right from O’Connor’s pages, Huston’sWise Bloodis an incisive portrait of spirituality and Evangelicalism, and a faithful, loving evocation of a writer’s vision.",John Huston,United States,1979,English,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/604f95c6bfb50dba8e5f1c7b2513a5ab/H8hXQBgkkXPHZqc0aeBelkFeh3rrcU_large.jpg,0080140

1206,WOMAN IN THE DUNES,"One of the 1960s’ great international art-house sensations,Woman in the Dunes(Suna no onna) was for many the grand unveiling of the surreal, idiosyncratic world of Hiroshi Teshigahara. Eiji Okada plays an amateur entomologist who has left Tokyo to study an unclassified species of beetle found in a vast desert. When he misses his bus back to civilization, he is persuaded to spend the night with a young widow (Kyoko Kishida) in her hut at the bottom of a sand dune. What results is one of cinema’s most unnerving and palpably erotic battles of the sexes, as well as a nightmarish depiction of everyday life as a Sisyphean struggle—an achievement that garnered Teshigahara an Academy Award nomination for best director.",Hiroshi Teshigahara,Japan,1964,Japanese,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/98fca346151a9909ce777d3c7bcf4e14/NiN005MtaZLuhUJZOq7z7jOk0wRd02_large.jpg,0058625

Featuring French superstars Anna Karina, Jean-Paul Belmondo, and Jean-Claude Brialy at their peak of popularity,A Woman Is a Womanis a sly, playful tribute to—and interrogation of—the American musical comedy, showcasing Godard''s signature wit and intellectual acumen. The film tells the story of exotic dancer Angéla (Karina) as she attempts to have a child with her unwilling lover Émile (Brialy). In the process, she finds herself torn between him and his best friend Alfred (Belmondo).

This tale of two newspaper reporters who wed and then discover that their careers aren’t so compatible forges a fresh and realistic vision of what marriage can be. The freewheeling but pinpoint-sharp screenplay by Ring Lardner Jr. and Michael Kanin won an Academy Award, and Hepburn received a nomination for her performance.Woman of the Yearis a dazzling, funny, and rueful observation of what it takes for men and women to get along—both in the workplace and outside of it.",George Stevens,United States,1942,English,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/071ae95341fa2d7d2de4a902fb53e6d9/WtdpX8O6LfK9p7DgnEyDD8lBnpaaAw_large.jpg,0035567

Gustaf Molander directs, meticulously hiding and revealing Bergman’s features as necessary. After Anna is given an operation to restore her looks, she embarks on a scheme that requires her to go undercover as a nanny to a rich family, but as her personality softens and she discovers maternal instincts she never knew she had, her latest plot is put in jeopardy.

1211,WOMEN IN LOVE,"With this film, the audacious Ken Russell vaulted onto the international stage, drawing on the psychosexual radicalism of D. H. Lawrence’s classic novel to shatter taboos in his own time.

1236,ZATOICHI IN DESPERATION,"Star Shintaro Katsu sits in the director’s chair for this psychedelic and unremittingly bleak entry in the Zatoichi series, which is unlike any other in its grind-house grimness.
