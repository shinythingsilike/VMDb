    "teststring = \"Passport No. 0A046319. My name is THAHER, Fatina DOB: 03-06-1973  UCI: 11-5742-5241  I landed with my family in Canada on Aug 15, 2010. I have been working and living in Canada since 2013. I had a permanent resident status till 2022. I was granted the Canadian Citizenship on Jul 2022. I am contacting you today regarding boarders related issue. As I said, I landed in Canada as an immigrant on Aug 15, 2010. I stayed for one month then I left the country since I was living and working in Dubai at the time. My plan was to stay in Dubai for 3 more years to save money for my life expenses in Canada after I move there. I visited Canada again in 2011 and 2012 to do my pharmacy practice examinations. In one of my visits likely in 2012, the boarders officer asked me why I am not staying in Canada as of yet? I told her because I am living with my family in Dubai and that I am here to do my pharmacy practice exams. My name was flagged for some reason at that time. Each time I come back to Canada I will ALWAYS be questioned by the officers The last incident was on Sat Jan 21, 2023. I asked the officer if the flag can be removed? he told me that he is not sure he eventually promised to talk to his boss to fix this. Can you please provide me with the reason I always been held by in the airport for? Also, Can you please bring this issue up to the boarders agency to get my name cleared?\""

       "'Passport No. 0A046319. My name is THAHER, Fatina DOB: 03-06-1973  UCI: 11-5742-5241  I landed with my family in Canada on Aug 15, 2010. I have been working and living in Canada since 2013. I had a permanent resident status till 2022. I was granted the Canadian Citizenship on Jul 2022. I am contacting you today regarding boarders related issue. As I said, I landed in Canada as an immigrant on Aug 15, 2010. I stayed for one month then I left the country since I was living and working in Dubai at the time. My plan was to stay in Dubai for 3 more years to save money for my life expenses in Canada after I move there. I visited Canada again in 2011 and 2012 to do my pharmacy practice examinations. In one of my visits likely in 2012, the boarders officer asked me why I am not staying in Canada as of yet? I told her because I am living with my family in Dubai and that I am here to do my pharmacy practice exams. My name was flagged for some reason at that time. Each time I come back to Canada I will ALWAYS be questioned by the officers The last incident was on Sat Jan 21, 2023. I asked the officer if the flag can be removed? he told me that he is not sure he eventually promised to talk to his boss to fix this. Can you please provide me with the reason I always been held by in the airport for? Also, Can you please bring this issue up to the boarders agency to get my name cleared?'"
