It started with keeping a record of all media content my husband and I consumed since March 19, 2020 in a book. All 45 pages were scanned via Google Lens's OCR feature and stored in a .csv file. 
Everything was uploaded to SQL and processed via Jupyter Notebook/Lab and processed with the IMDb Cinemagoer module (https://imdbpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/index.html).
